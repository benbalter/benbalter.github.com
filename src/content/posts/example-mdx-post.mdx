This is an example blog post written in **MDX** format. MDX allows you to use JSX components directly in your Markdown content, enabling rich, interactive blog posts.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines Markdown with JSX. It allows you to:

* Write content in Markdown
* Import and use React/Astro components
* Create interactive, dynamic content
* Keep your content maintainable and reusable

<Callout type="info" title="Why MDX?">
MDX gives you the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown with the power of components. This makes your content more engaging and easier to maintain.
</Callout>

## Using Custom Components

### Callout Component

Here are some examples of the Callout component with different types:

<Callout type="success" title="Success!">
This is a success callout. Use it to highlight positive outcomes or completed tasks.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues or important considerations.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Error">
This is an error callout. Use it to highlight critical issues or things to avoid.
</Callout>

### Code Block Component

The CodeBlock component adds a title bar to your code examples:

<CodeBlock title="example.js" language="javascript">
```javascript
// This code block has a custom title
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

const message = greetUser('Astro User');
console.log(message);
```
</CodeBlock>

### YouTube Component

You can embed YouTube videos easily:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Example Video" />

## Mixing Markdown and Components

You can seamlessly mix standard Markdown with custom components:

Here's a regular Markdown paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

<Callout type="info">
And here's a component right in the middle of the content!
</Callout>

Followed by more regular Markdown content.

### Standard Markdown Features

All standard Markdown features still work:

1. Ordered lists
2. With multiple items
3. Work perfectly

* Unordered lists too
* They integrate seamlessly
* With components

```python
# Code blocks without the component wrapper
def example():
    return "This also works!"
```

## Interactive Content

MDX enables you to create truly interactive blog posts. While this example uses static components, you could add:

* Interactive charts and visualizations
* Live code editors
* Embedded tools and calculators
* Dynamic content that responds to user input

<Callout type="success" title="MDX Benefits">
MDX transforms your blog from static content to an interactive experience, all while maintaining the simplicity of writing in Markdown.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the power of MDX in Astro. You get:

* ✅ All standard Markdown features
* ✅ Type-safe frontmatter validation
* ✅ Custom, reusable components
* ✅ Jekyll compatibility
