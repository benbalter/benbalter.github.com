One the one hand, GW&#8217;s primary Twitter account, @GWTweets, casts the University in a stoic, buttoned-up light, with little, if any interactions with members of the rather active online community (<em>e.g.</em>, mentions, @replies, or ReTweets). @GWToday on the other hand, the <em>de facto</em>hub of the campus&#8217;s Twitter scene, and arguably a <a href='http://www.socialmediahighered.com/'>significant presence in higher education&#8217;s social media world</a>, has historically taken a more cavalier approach to serving as the University&#8217;s digital face.

Social media is not a megaphone for a flaks to broadcast the press releases they would otherwise post elsewhere, but rather a cocktail party that provide organizations with the unique opportunity to loosen their tie, grab a drink, and work the room.</p>\n\n<p>There is a generation of communications directors and public affairs vice presidents out there that see the liberalizing power of social media as a <em>liability</em>, rather than an <em>opportunity</em>. Personal interaction with stakeholders, be they students at a university or just those who enjoy <a href='http://twitter.com/jimmyjohns'>delicious, delicious sandwiches</a>,<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> allow organizations to connect with the people most passionate about their brand in a very real way. Just as it is second nature for city dwellers to walk past solicitors handing out pamphlets on the street corner, as the culture surrounding the technology continues to evolve so too will Twitter community begin to ostracize those members who refuse to join the ongoing digital dialog.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, Twitter is not a dumping ground for pre-vetted paper.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> The occasional typo or personal quip doesn&#8217;t hurt a company&#8217;s reputation, but rather humanizes it. So long as @GWToday (or any corporate handle for that matter) falls short of sharing a <a href='http://search.twitter.com/search?q=nom+twitpic'>picture of what they&#8217;re having for lunch</a>, we can only hope that they continue to be the model for establishing an online presence, rather than the exception.</p>\n\n<p><em>[Photo: <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/tranchis/3708549622/'>tranchis</a>]</em></p>\n<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>\n<p>Without too much of a history lesson, see, e.g., Abraham Lincoln overseeing the Civil War from the telegraph office ushering in a new era of hands-on presidential leadership; home telephones giving rise to entire industries dedicated to interrupting families&#8217; dinners; Blackberrys changing business e-mail etiquette.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>\n<p>Jimmy John&#8217;s often frat-boy-esq vocabulary may push the limits of informal interactions with stakeholders, but none-the-less serves to promote their brand.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:3'>\n<p>Thank the internet gods that TwitterFeed‘s RSS to Twitter conversion service didn&#8217;t catch on.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>","content":"<p><a href='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg' />Today&#8217;s New York Times article <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology' title='NYT: U.S. Tries to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet'>outlining law enforcement officials&#8217; attempts to expand their digital wiretapping authority</a>, offers interesting insight into the law enforcement world of tomorrow. In the not too distant future, TV&#8217;s crime-process dramas may take on a very different feel.

Don&#8217;t be surprised if the next CSI spinoff is CSI: Inbox Inspectors Division.</p>\n\n<p>But why does this shift matter? Simply put, in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing' title='Wikipedia: Cloud Computing'>the cloud</a>, there is no door for the police to kick in. While the law is clear in that your physical files and those computer files stored on your computer itself enjoy the protections of the fourth amendment, those stored in the cloud do not, and the standards of proof required differ dramatically.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><img alt='' src='http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg' /></p>\n\n<p>Consider this: you are the target of a criminal investigation and the police believe that six months ago you e-mailed an accomplice to discuss the crime. Depending on your e-mail settings and which service you use (e.g., if the &#8221;<a href='http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/leave-e-mail-messages-on-your-e-mail-server-HA001150793.aspx'>leave downloaded messages on server</a>&#8221; option is checked), the police may need only offer &#8220;specific and articulable facts&#8221; that they suspect the e-mail is related to the crime.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> That same e-mail stored on your computer (e.g., if the setting is not checked), would require a search warrant and showing of probable cause, and thus would be afforded significantly greater protections under the law.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>However, the typical &#8221;<em>if you don&#8217;t want it public, don&#8217;t put it on the internet</em>&#8221; argument doesn&#8217;t apply here. While that may be true for <a href='http://youropenbook.org/' title='Your Open Book'>photos and updates posted to social networking sites</a>, as more and more of our lives (and <a href='http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/customers.html' title='Google Business Customers'>commercial dealings</a>) are pushed to the cloud, we&#8217;re loosing our abilities to have a digital private sphere.<sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The good news is that it&#8217;s in service providers&#8217; interest to instill confidence in the integrity of your data by <a href='http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/' title='Google Government Inqueries'>disclosing when information is shared with authorities</a> and by <a href='http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163' title='Digital Due Process'>pushing for legal reform</a>to better safeguard personal data stored in the cloud.
