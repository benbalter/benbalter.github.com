Every so often I come across a site or Twitter account that really helps people either navigate public media offerings or surfaces public media content in an interesting way. Here are several:

  * [NPR My Ride][1] &#8211; find a list of member stations between two cities ([Twitter][2])
  * [NPR.Today][3] &#8211; an NPR player based on the clock
  * [Public Radio Map][4] &#8211; outlines of all of the station boundaries from the FCC
  * [WBEZ Bot][5] &#8211; tweets what&#8217;s playing on WBEZ (similar to the bot we created, [@findmystation][6])

I would love to see more of these pop up. You can learn a lot about audio &#8212; and how to think about audio &#8212; by building something that can help your local public radio station. Here is information about the [Public Media Platform][7] and how to get started digging around a hypermedia API. And here are several ideas, if you&#8217;d like to build something but don&#8217;t know where to start.

  * A site that shows the last X pieces published in public media.
  * A site that shows the most shared published in public media over X time frame.
  * A site that surfaces a public media interview related to any particular day on a calendar. (Use the Wikipedia API. [Start here][8].)
  * A site that shows me public media interviews related to a particular historical event.
  * A site which features the earliest public media interview conducted with X.
  * For that matter, there should be a repository of the first time X was mentioned on public media &#8212; whether X was sushi, Saddam Hussein, or any other word from the latter half of the 20th century. Ooh. This might require machine learning.

I have many more ideas and am always trying to think of ways to resurface already existing content. If you also like thinking about this, let me know.
