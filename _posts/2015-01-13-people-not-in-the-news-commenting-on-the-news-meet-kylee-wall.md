Meet [Kylee Wall][1]. She&#8217;s a full-time [film and TV editor][2] and a part-time portrait photographer. She has a cat named Pixel and loves to travel.Â &#8220;My favorite trip so far was LA (for an American Cinema Editors event), followed closely by being stranded in New York during a blizzard (for an American Film Institute directing workshop for women),&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m a huge advocate for services like Airbnb and RelayRides, for feminism and equality, and for more television shows like X-Files and Twin Peaks.&#8221;

Kylee, who tweets [@kyl33t][3], was kind enough to answer some questions about how she gets her news. If you&#8217;d like to read the others in the series, [please click here][4], and if you want to take part, just let me know.

**1. How do you get your news?**

Primarily through social media, which is something I realized would be a regular thing in 2009 when I found out about and followed the Ft. Collins [balloon boy hoax][5] entirely [through Twitter][6]. Breaking news hits my Twitter feed the fastest, but Tumblr has also become a good discovery tool for &#8220;smaller&#8221; stories. Besides that, NPR radio (mostly [Morning Edition][7] and [All Things Considered][8]) and Al Jazeera&#8217;s [posts on Facebook][9].

A few months ago I decided to add [CNN][10] and [USA Today][11] push notifications to my phone to see if there was news I was missing. The result of that experiment is a whole lot more noise with little gain, with regular updates on the stock market and sporting events or celebrity gossip &#8212; my own feeds are much more tailored to things I care about.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Black. Matches my attire.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Comedians. [Colbert][13], [Stewart][14] and [Oliver][15]. They put together graceful, insightful commentary pieces that are well-researched and often self-deprecating, and I feel like I learn deeper facts about an issue through ten minutes with them than ten minutes of talking heads on CNN.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The OJ Simpson verdict. This is also the first news event I remember discussing. I was in third grade and we had heated debates on the school bus. (First television event discussion was also on the bus: the reveal of the white Power Ranger.)

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I learned that my gender equality activism within the industry I work in is being given a major conference platform in the coming months, which is pretty awesome.

9. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.

I&#8217;m currently in Atlanta. I was born and raised in central Indiana.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

The 24 hour cable news cycle. When a major event happens, I used to go to CNN for fast and curated updates about what&#8217;s happening. But every time I do that, I&#8217;m saturated with speculation, repetitious segments, or irresponsible reporting. Then I have to withdraw from current events for a period of time because I can&#8217;t take it anymore. There has to be a better way than making a horrifying incident into a sporting event.

**11. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**

I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts while I do chores because I tend to stop when something is really blowing my mind. I once fell off the treadmill at a gym while listening to the &#8220;[Colors][16]&#8221; episode of Radiolab. When I&#8217;m not a danger to myself, [Radiolab][17] and [Serial][18] are two of my favorites.

**12. How do you get your news when you travel?**

The nice thing about social media is that it doesn&#8217;t care when you travel. It&#8217;s still entirely possible to keep up with everything just the same. I have my Twitter follows sorted into [lists][19] with people who have a higher concentration of good links or current events tweets on one of them, so I can quickly switch to a focused list when I&#8217;m looking to be more specific.
