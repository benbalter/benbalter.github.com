Meet [Lynsey Smith][1]. She lives in a rural town in Oregon named Oakland. &#8220;Most people assume I mean SF when I talk about Oakland,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t born here but I grew up here and recently moved back. It&#8217;s no fun at all for a young unmarried person without kids, but there is a lot of positive change to be made here.&#8221;

Lynsey is a self-described news junkie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been obsessed with current events, news & politics since I could drive to track down a copy of WSJ, 15 miles from my house,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I majored in political science and worked on the 2008 Obama campaign, in Idaho of all places.&#8221;

Now she works in the tech space in a variety of ways. &#8220;I most enjoy using my skills for creative strategy and event planning,&#8221; she says. &#8220;In 2012, I put my event planning skills to good use by creating [Portland Girl Geek Dinners][2] to create a safe space for all varieties of women in tech. I am very passionate about increasing access to resources for minorities and as well as those from lower economic backgrounds.&#8221;

Lynsey also teaches. &#8220;These days, I teach tech skills at [Cobb School][3] and at Oakland Elementary School,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I also coach cheerleading. In such a small rural like Douglas Country, where the economy is struggling to recover after being so dependent on lumber, a great technological education has the ability to help these kids lead better lives. For many of them, that includes being able to end the cycle of poverty.&#8221;

I found myself wanting to be Lynsey&#8217;s friend, after reading everything she&#8217;s done. Below, her answers on how she gets her news. If you&#8217;d like to participate in this series, please let me now. (The archives live [here][4].)

**1. How do you get your news? Please answer in a haiku or limerick. Your choice.**

Kudos to anyone who can respond in a limerick or haiku.

I get a vast majority of my news from digital content in some form; I listen to [BBC][5] & [CNN][6] on the XM Radio App, I follow my favorite news outlets on social media &#8211; specifically Twitter, the [NYTimes app][7], [WSJ Live app][8] on Apple Tv, emails like [Daily Skimm][9].

**2. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I love the [Skimm][9], their daily emails are spectacular. I&#8217;m also a fan of [Vox][10], I like how they break down issues with data. Who doesn&#8217;t love news backed by data?!

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Generally, iced and very sweet, vanilla or caramel and very large.

**4. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

I&#8217;m extremely ADHD so [this video][11] is a pretty accurate portrayal of my daily life.

**5. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I work a second job, because surprise&#8230; teaching doesn&#8217;t pay as well as waitressing in an upscale restaurant in Oakland. Anyway, last night I mentioned to one of my guests that I work with two different schools and somehow I started on my rant about needing more computers for rural schools. She told me what she did for a living and offered to help secure funds for a few new(er) computers for one of the schools I work with. Not only was that totally unexpected, it was just an amazing feeling to have a stranger believe in what I&#8217;m doing with these schools and offer to help out.

**6. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

This isn&#8217;t the first but it&#8217;s something I remember very well. I vividly remember the 2000 Presidential Election, I was in middle school. &#8216;Hanging Chads&#8217; was a topic of conversation at school among teachers and at home with my parents. It&#8217;s the first time I remember something major happening and trying to learn more about it.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

I hate how polarizing it can be and how partisan it can be. I also hate how some outlets &#8216;dumb down&#8217; their coverage. I don&#8217;t want or need a watered down version of what&#8217;s happening in the world. I think things like that contribute to feelings of apathy and disconnect, which are no good.

**11. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**

I generally listen to XM while doing chores but I do listen [Call Your Girlfriend][12] (hell yeah TLM) and any of [Scott Hanselman][13]&#8216;s podcast. Scott is so talented, not to mention an amazing human being.
