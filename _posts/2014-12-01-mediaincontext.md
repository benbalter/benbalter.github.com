Over the past few days, I followed tweets coming out of Doha, Qatar at a [media innovation hackathon][1] put on by Al Jazeera. This was quite easy, because Phillip Smith wrote up [his detailed notes][2] to prepare for the hackathon, which offered  [12 possible challenges][2] for participants to explore:

My favorite ideas to come out of the hackathon:

  * [Lasertag][3], which helps make archival stories more relevant through structured data and text mining. ([github][4])
  * [Hakawati][5], which is kind of like Siri for news.
  * [StreetStories][6], which allows you to explore news stories through sound and place
  * [Headitor][7], which customizes headlines for editors and makes it much easier to put keywords in headlines
  * [tinyfm][8], which brings the web back to radio. Like terrestrial radio.
  * [NewsClip.se][9], which surfaces relevant information about subjects to reporters/the audience using a variety of APIs

I had trouble picking these six. As you can see, [all of the ideas][10] that came out of this hackathon were quite good. And they&#8217;re all open source, so you can use them in your newsroom!

  As an aside, this is the inaugural entry on my new website. I&#8217;ll be focusing on the future of news, projects that interest me, and great examples I see from others in the news industry. Welcome!
