As I began to set up my own site, I was not a huge fan of the options out there for adding a resume or CV to a WordPress blog. Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can't even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.[^1] A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.
