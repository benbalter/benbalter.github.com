One of my favorite [perks of working at GitHub](https://github.com/about/jobs) is the fact that the company covers all your work-related reading. That (plus a good deal of travel over the years) means that I've read quite a few books about technology, about open source, and about business.

If those topics sound interesting, here are some of [**my favorite books for hackers, for geeks, and for open source developers**](http://ben.balter.com/books-for-geeks/).

Of course, if you have a recommendation, I'm always looking for new books to read. Let me know in the comments below.
