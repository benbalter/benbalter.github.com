[F. Scott Stinner][1] is a 25-year-old PhD student in electrical engineering and a really fantastic cook/baker. He is also a really talented musician and can basically play any brass instrument. He also is hilarious&#8230;.and likes a good smell. In his words, &#8220;I also enjoy things that are scented, like candles and air fresheners. I always enjoy when my home smells nice, whether it be from baking or a candle.&#8221;

Scott was kind enough to answer some questions about how he gets his news. If you donâ€™t work in news, live outside of DC/NYC, and would like to participate, let me know. (Rest of series [is here][2])

&nbsp;

**1. How do you get your news?**

I read what&#8217;s trending on Facebook and watch the [Daily Show][3] during my lunch break.  
When driving, I listen to [KYW 1060][4] to catch up on more general and local news.  
If I want to look up a national news story online, I look up one of my hometown news channels, [69 from Allentown, PA][5] or [16 from Scranton][6]. Most of it is just copy-pasted from AP reports, but it&#8217;s quickly updated and at least mostly impartial.  
And I don&#8217;t really watch TV news. My schedule is too irregular. I have to catch up when I can.

**2. What instrument do you play? **

Tuba/trombone/baritone

**3. What do you think is the best middle name?**

Cornelius

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I watch [Jon Stewart][3] daily, and I really like [John Oliver][7]. I appreciate more long-form, comedic journalism.  
And, as I said earlier, small local news. Everyone else is just putting up clickbait. I go to a local news website, I read a headline that gives me a summary and a concise article. That&#8217;s all I want to read.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The OJ Simpson trial. I was young when it happened and didn&#8217;t really understand it, but it made me refuse to drink orange juice for quite sometime because all we ever heard about in the evening on the TV was OJ.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I got engaged! <img src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" />

**8. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.**

Newark, DE but I work/socialize in Philly.

**9. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

Political spin. Everyone has an agenda and a viewpoint. No one seems impartial anymore and just reporting what happened. And I hate it from either side. Even if I support the view, I don&#8217;t need it reiterated for me.  
And click-bait and lists. I don&#8217;t want to read 16 ways this could have happened or be offered to click to see what happened. I want to know what I&#8217;m reading before I read it and I want to know what happened. That&#8217;s it.

Sorry if I ranted a bit. This is something that actually frustrates me a lot. I never really know what to read or watch. I&#8217;ve been pointed many places to go, but it&#8217;s all such a crap-shoot as to what will be good. It makes me wish I was this age when Peter Jennings was still on TV.
