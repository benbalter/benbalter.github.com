  Meet my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ericsmithrocks">Eric</a>. Eric lives in Philadelphia, where he occasionally <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/08/30/eric-smith-as-master-chief-from-halo-visits-rittenhouse/">walks around in a Halo costume</a>. He also runs the <a href="http://ericsmithrocks.com/projects/">Philadelphia Geek Awards</a> and works on projects that make the city a much better place to live. Eric was kind enough to answer some questions about how he gets his news. To see others in the series, <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">click here</a>. If you&#8217;d like to be in the series, please let me know.

  <b>1. How do you get your news?</b>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Generally via blogs. And I&#8217;m weird about it. Instead of maintaining a proper feed of all the blogs I read, I keep a monstrous bookmark folder with every single blog I like, and open it every morning. &#8220;Are you sure you want to open 22 tabs?&#8221; Google Chrome asks. &#8220;YES I AM!&#8221; I respond, every single morning. I mash the okay button, and watch my poor iMac grow slower and slower.<br /> </span></p>

    <b>3. How do you take your coffee?</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Hazelnut or Vanilla creme, with a horrible amount of sugar that would offend real coffee drinkers.

    <b>4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?</b>

  <div>
    That&#8217;s a tricky one! I feel like I get it from everywhere. In Philadelphia, I&#8217;m a big fan of the alternative weeklys. Hi <a href="http://citypaper.net/">CityPaper</a>! Hi <a href="http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/">Philly Weekly</a>! And <a href="http://www.newsworks.org/">NewsWorks</a> and <a href="http://billypenn.com/">Billy Penn</a> are always doing cool things. Give me innovation and pair it with compelling, awesome storytelling! Keep my attention! That&#8217;s what I want.

    <b>5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?</b>

  </div>
  
  <div>
    Like, one I went to? Maybe the unconferences here in Philadelphia? Probably my first <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/">BarCamp</a>. Listening to bloggers and journalists talk about ways to report the news and tell good stories. Always interesting.

  It&#8217;s early in the week, but probably when I got White Castle <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1771297464"><span class="aQJ">on Sunday</span></span>, tweeted a photo of my fiancee + the sliders, and White Castle tweeted back &#8220;you have good taste.&#8221; Now we are definitely getting married. Me and my fiancee, that is. Not me and White Castle. Hah, that would be silly. Right? Marrying White Castle&#8230; sigh.
