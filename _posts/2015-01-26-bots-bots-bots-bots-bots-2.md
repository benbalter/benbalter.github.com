[@tinysubversons][1] makes bots. Here is a [community-created resource][2] he recently shared on how to make your own bot, if you’re so inclined. Here is [a list of bots][3] that he has created. My favorite bot he&#8217;s made is [@twoheadlines][4], which mashes up headlines from two different news articles (and [here’s a piece][5] on how it works.) Wikipedia is often edited by bots. You can see the [percentage of bots vs. humans][6] editing Wikipedia in real time. [There&#8217;s also a bot][7] that tweets anonymous edits made to Wikipedia from IP addresses in Congress.

Here are three ideas for bots:

1. A bot that predicts employment shifts within sports, media, politics and publishing based on an abnormal rise in followers from a particular employer within a certain period of time. Example: Bot says &#8220;30 people from the Philadelphia Phillies have just followed @person in the past day.&#8221;  
2. A bot that makes up random bits from NYT wedding announcements. Example: &#8220;The bride is a descendent from NOUN,&#8221; where NOUN is taken from a random list of occupations. Or something.  
3. A bot that shares a random piece of content from a random local public media station every day.

If you are interested in building any of these bots, let me know. I have a bit of Python knowledge and would love to work with others making one of these. Want to get my newsletter? I am sending out things like this sporadically:
