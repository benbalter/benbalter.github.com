title: "N things every conference should have"

I've probably been to more than a hundred technology conferences over the past few years. Some were great, but not all were good. Here's N things I wish every technology conference organizer knew:

### 1. Bulletproof wifi is non-negotiable

If you're a technology conference, you can safely assume most talks are going to involve live demos, participants are going to want to Tweet, Myspace, or whatever the talk, and in between sessions, conference goers still have a day job to which their responsible. If the wifi's slow or unreliable, none of that can happen. The venue's going to say their single Linksys router is the best one Best Buy had on sale, but they're lying. Assume 2-3 devices per participants, none of which have an ethernet port, and plan accordingly.

### 2. Optimized the badge for attendees, not organizers

There's a conference badge anti-pattern, where, in an attempt to brand the event (in case you forget where you are), the largest percentage of badge real estate is given to the conference logo, with things like tracks, or other badge "classes" being given the 2nd most real estate. People go to conferences to network. Optimize for social interactions. Ensure badges are double sided, if the lanyard allows them to flip, and ensure the conference goers name and organization, not yours, are the first thing you see.

### 3. Outlets, outlets everywhere

We're geeks. We've got a million things with screens, and we're going to spend all day on the darn things. Hotels and other conference venues strategically place outlets along walls for two purposes: vacuuming and quad-box drops to support head tables in various room arrangements. Conference goers should sit where they want to sit, not on the floor or against the wall. Power strips and extension chords are cheap, but go a long way to freeing conference goers to worry about the conference, not when they're going to get their next ion fix.

### 4. Record every talk

The people in the room are only a small subset the audience for a given talk. The biggest impact the talk will have is when conference goers return home and talk about what they learned. Not to mention, conferences are expensive, and not everyone can be there in person. For the speaker, that means their ideas have a larger reach. For the conference, that means their branding reaches more eyeballs, as they show off what great speakers they attracted, and serves as free advertising for following years.

### 5. Sponsors aren't there to show off their logo

Sponsorship packages are funny things. They're almost always some variation of "give us a check" and "we'll put your logo someplace", or if the check is large enough "we'll say you're name in a microphone". While easy for conference organizers, that's a terrible experience for sponsors and attendees. Nobody learns anything from having a logo shoved in their face. In much of the close-knit technology world, sponsors support an event, not for brand exposure, but to talk to customers and to support the ecosystem itself. Craft sponsorships that create real value for everyone involved, be they monetary, in kind, or something more creative.

### 6. Offer scholarships on a needs basis

There's a broader discussion to be had about equality of opportunity in the technology community, but one thing's for sure, at $800+ a pop for the badge alone, lots of smart people who have lots to contribute can't attend. Rather than giving sponsors dozens of conference passes they're not going to use, swap a few out for sponsorship slots to support a local startup or fly a student across the country. GitHub's done this frequently, and it's some of the best sponsorship dollars we've spent, IMHO.

### 7. Scan groceries, not humans



### 8.
