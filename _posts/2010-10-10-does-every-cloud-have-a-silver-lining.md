title: Does Every Cloud Have a Silver Lining?
excerpt: >
  Thunderstorms occur when divergent
  forces collide in clouds. It is becoming
  increasingly clear that cloud computing
  is in our extended forecast, but whether
  the imminent digital due process storm
  the cloud foreshadows will contain a
  silver privacy lining remains to be
  seen.

[][1]Today’s New York Times article <a title="NYT: U.S. Tries to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html?_r=1&ref=technology" target="_blank">outlining law enforcement officials’ attempts to expand their digital wiretapping authority</a>, offers interesting insight into the law enforcement world of tomorrow.  In the not too distant future, TV’s crime-process dramas may take on a very different feel.  Gone will be the days of <a title="Hulu: Best of Swatch Breaches" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/53368/swat-best-of-breaches" target="_blank">gun-toting detectives busting down doors, search warrant in hand</a>. Instead, as our lives become increasingly digital, investigations will be conducted by <a title="CSI Miami IP Address Lookup" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z70BmmSkMY&feature=related" target="_blank">keyboard-wielding lab techs submitting automated requests to service providers</a>.  Don’t be surprised if the next CSI spinoff is CSI: Inbox Inspectors Division.

But why does this shift matter?  Simply put, in <a title="Wikipedia: Cloud Computing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">the cloud</a>, there is no door for the police to kick in.  While the law is clear in that your physical files and those computer files stored on your computer itself enjoy the protections of the fourth amendment, those stored in the cloud do not, and the standards of proof required differ dramatically <a class="simple-footnote" title="Compare Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)(2)(B) with 18 U.S.C.A. § 2703(d) (West)." id="return-note-2020-1" href="#note-2020-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

  <a href="http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg"></a><img class="aligncenter" title="Cloud Computing - 500px" src="http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4502026170_4bf31f04e6.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="320" />

Consider this: you are the target of a criminal investigation and the police believe that six months ago you e-mailed an accomplice to discuss the crime. Depending on your e-mail settings and which service you use (e.g., if the “<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/leave-e-mail-messages-on-your-e-mail-server-HA001150793.aspx" target="_blank">leave downloaded messages on server</a>” option is checked), the police may need only offer “specific and articulable facts” that they suspect the e-mail is related to the crime <a class="simple-footnote" title="18 U.S.C.A. § 2703(d) (West)." id="return-note-2020-2" href="#note-2020-2"><sup>2</sup></a>. That same e-mail stored on your computer (e.g., if the setting is not checked), would require a search warrant and showing of probable cause, and thus would be afforded significantly greater protections under the law <a class="simple-footnote" title="See generally Obtaining Electronic Evidence, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (July 2003)." id="return-note-2020-3" href="#note-2020-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

However, the typical “*if you don’t want it public, don’t put it on the internet*” argument doesn’t apply here.  While that may be true for <a title="Your Open Book" href="http://youropenbook.org/" target="_blank">photos and updates posted to social networking sites</a>, as more and more of our lives (and <a title="Google Business Customers" href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/customers.html" target="_blank">commercial dealings</a>) are pushed to the cloud, we’re loosing our abilities to have a digital private sphere <a class="simple-footnote" title="Take Google, as an example, who, to their credit, is a front-runner in the push toward digital due process, testifying on the Hill just last week. Without signing up for a Google account, through the use of cookies, Google can compile a relatively accurate profile of what Web sites you visit and how often you visit them, what products you purchase, and where you go. And if you sign-up for a near-ubiquitous Google account, you introduce the cloud to what others are saying about you, what you read, files stored on your computer, and even your medical history, not to mention with whom you communicate, what you’re doing, and where you are right now." id="return-note-2020-4" href="#note-2020-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

The good news is that it’s in service providers’ interest to instill confidence in the integrity of your data by <a title="Google Government Inqueries" href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/" target="_blank">disclosing when information is shared with authorities</a> and by <a title="Digital Due Process" href="http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163" target="_blank">pushing for legal reform </a>to better safeguard personal data stored in the cloud. The bad news, beyond more <a title="YouTube: CSI Blog Search" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU" target="_blank">painfully tacky computer search scenes</a>, is that before we know it, our perception of privacy may be forced to evolve.

Thunderstorms occur when divergent forces collide in clouds. It is becoming increasingly clear that cloud computing is in our extended forecast, but whether the imminent <a href="http://digitaldueprocess.org/" target="_blank">digital due process</a> storm the cloud foreshadows will contain a silver privacy lining remains to be seen.
