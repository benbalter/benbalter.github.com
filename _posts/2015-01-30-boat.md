If I had a boat, I would name it &#8220;#boat.&#8221; But I get seasick, so I don&#8217;t think a boat is in my cards.

Speaking of cards, I&#8217;m very intrigued by <a href="https://medium.com/de-correspondent/links-are-broken-these-three-alternatives-have-improved-our-readers-reading-experience-796c302c8930" data-cke-saved-href="https://medium.com/de-correspondent/links-are-broken-these-three-alternatives-have-improved-our-readers-reading-experience-796c302c8930">the info cards</a> mentioned in this piece. I wonder why we limit ourselves to thinking vertically. My friend Kevin is <a href="http://fold.media.mit.edu/" data-cke-saved-href="http://fold.media.mit.edu/">thinking about the horizontal</a> plane as a way to provide more or different information to readers. The KnightLab created <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">Timeline.js</a> to think about time as a means to tell stories. <a href="http://timeline.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://timeline.com/">Timeline</a> is a new app that just launched that also uses a timeline as a frame for stories. <a href="https://www.detour.com/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.detour.com/">Detour</a> just launched; it uses geography as a way to frame and then stories.

How else can we frame stories? How else should we tell stories? What are the actions throughout our day that may provide insight?

Happy Weekend,
