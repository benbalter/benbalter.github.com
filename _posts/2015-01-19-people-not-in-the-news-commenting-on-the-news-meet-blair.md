Meet [Blair Reeves][1]. He lives in Durham, NC and works at a cloud commerce company. He [blogs][2], enjoys barbecue and used to work in global health. In his words, &#8220;I try to combine the best parts of rural Southerner and urban West Coast techy person into one, with a little more humor and less presumption.&#8221; Definitely my type of person, particularly with his proclivity for sweet tea.

I asked Blair some questions about how he takes his news. If you’d like to read the others in the series, [please click here][3], and if you want to take part, just let me know.

**1. How do you get your news?**

Mostly the [NYT online][4] (I have a subscription), Twitter, sometimes the [NPR app][5]. I also read [The Atlantic][6] in hardcopy (also subscribed) on planes. Sometimes read [Vox][7]/[Quartz][8], but infrequently.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

[I&#8217;d forgotten about this!][9]

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Strong and rich.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

[The Atlantic][6], [Madrigal][10], [Ezra Klein][11], [BuzzFeed][12], [Vox][7], probably [NPR][13] in their own way

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Challenger disaster (sort of)

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

Terrific holiday party with close friends last weekend. Got to meet some new ones at some random person&#8217;s Hannukah party last night too.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

The lack of perspective and sensationalism. The ones who do this most (ex. Fox, MSNBC, CNN) aren&#8217;t really &#8220;news&#8221; any more so much as info-tainment, and I ignore them all. (Besides, I don&#8217;t have cable.)

It also depends what you call &#8220;news.&#8221; I follow a lot of tech industry and e-commerce tech &#8220;news&#8221; which is very specialized, and for that I follow specific blogs/websites.

**8. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**

I really dig the [a16z podcast][14]. Been listening to Ben Thompson ([Exponent][15]) and [Neil Cybart][16] (Above Avalon) podcasts too, but infrequently. I mostly just listen to podcasts while running.

**9. How do you get your news when you travel?**

[NPR news app][5]! And twitter.
