John Hart is a millennial who lives in Kansas City and doesn&#8217;t work in news. In his words, &#8220;[My] biggest hobbies include camping (when possible), reading books and having my heart broken by KC sports teams.&#8221; John was kind enough to answer some questions for me about his news consumption.

If you&#8217;d like to see others in the series, [click here][1]. If you don&#8217;t work in news, live outside of DC/NYC, and would like to be interviewed, let me know!

**1. How do you get your news?**

I surf Twitter in the morning while eating breakfast, listen to [NPR][2] on my way to work, and read [The New York Times][3] and [Wall Street Journal][4] online during lunches. And if some world event or story is really interesting me I will hunt down a foreign newspapers website and read their articles and just use the [Google Translate][5] option. I just don&#8217;t watch news on the TV &#8212; that seems to be the media&#8217;s chosen medium for scare tactics.

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

If something doesn&#8217;t interest me in the slightest, than I really have no attention at all and just jump to the next thing, I definitely find myself scanning an article and being like wow you tricked me with that headline and I really don&#8217;t care about this story and just moving on. So here is my gif:

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Blacker than a moonless midnight.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I&#8217;d have to say [Marketplace][7]. I consume a lot of news, but this is the one source where I don&#8217;t change the station or click to the next article. Stories are interesting and the perfect length and [they] can make some dull stuff fascinating. They are giving the people what they want.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

I would have been 6 or 7, and I don&#8217;t remember the specifics, but the big hoopla about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky stands out as the first news story I remember. Did I know the details, no. Did I know that Bill had done messed up? Yep.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

[Sturgill Simpson][8] concert.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

I&#8217;d say the biggest thing I hate is the dramatization. Instead of just saying it is winter and it can get cold, we have things like the Polar Vortex. The dramatization doesn&#8217;t just stick to weather patterns sadly. I also hate that newspapers like the WSJ and NYT play into the stereotypes we have created for Republicans and Democrats. This really comes out in the opinions columns, but that&#8217;s another conversation.

**8. Which Kansas City are you from? I get confused. **

From the Kansas side, living on the Missouri side now. Fair question!
