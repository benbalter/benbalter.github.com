I watched SNL&#8217;s 40th anniversary show tonight. Like many Saturday Night Lives, this one was good for a while and then&#8230;not so good.

But it was saved by a series of montages featuring the best moments of past Saturday Night Live. Which brings me to the point of this late-night newsletter. Tonight, SNL again reiterated that archives are REALLY GOOD TO RESURFACE.

  <span class="s1">Archives:</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">1. are cheaper to distribute than creating new content<br /> 2. are way easier to produce and fail-safe (thanks @missmagner)<br /> 3. are something that differentiate legacy-owned media companies from startups (note: you are now competing with them for your own archives.)<br /> 4. produce feelings of nostalgia which help span multiple generations<br /> 5. require consistent metadata, which can be categorized in all sorts of ways. (See: <a href="https://medium.com/thelist/64-ways-to-think-about-a-news-homepage-223c01952d26">64 News Homepages</a>.)<br /> 6. <a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/84127245861/socialsandbox-internet-anniversary-at-npr">can go viral</a>, because they produce feelings of nostalgia, which span multiple generations<br /> 7. need really, really good structured metadata.</p>

    When I was little, my grandfather used to take me to the library and we would look at the microfilms for newspapers from important dates in history. Now, I can go to the <a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser">Times Machine</a>. Did you know that when you type in a CAPTCHA code, you&#8217;re helping to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html">digitize books and newspapers</a>?

    <strong>How can we incentivize users to create additional metadata which could then be used to create new methods of distribution? #archivetalk</strong>
