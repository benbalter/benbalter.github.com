I grew up in a household that had four newspapers delivered every day. I would wake up and read the papers every morning before school. I started with the comics and Ann Landers and slowly migrated over to the rest of the paper. In 6th grade, I pitched the (very local) paper the idea that they needed a children&#8217;s page and that I needed to be the editor of this section. [Voila!][1] In 8th grade, I started emailing with a local reporter at the newspaper because I loved the way she wrote. She then left the paper and went on to write [very popular books][2].

Needless to say, I was a strange little child. But luckily, I had decent parents who allowed [my][3] [somewhat-strange][4] [interests][5] to flourish and never made me feel weird. So I decided to interview them for my series &#8220;[How Do You Get Your News][6]?&#8221;

Meet Robyn and Neil. They don&#8217;t work in the news business and they only know one person who does work in the news business. (It&#8217;s me.) They live in South Jersey. My mom tweets&#8230;[sort of][7]. My Dad plays [solitaire on the computer][8] and once did the ice bucket challenge in a [leopard-print bikini][9] (SFW) solely to make his children cringe online. So they get it.

Robyn and Neil always get a kick out of answering questions so here they are, talking about their news habits.

**1. How do you get your news? **

Dad says he gets his news from newspapers, radio, tv and the computer and I get mine from all except for newspapers. (**Ed note: My mom wrote these responses because my Dad hunts and pecks and this would have taken an hour.)**

**2. Who&#8217;s your favorite child?**

You are, says Mom **(Ed note: She says this to each child who asks and always says that child.) **Dad says 1/3 of each.

**3. TV news vs. radio news vs. the newspaper. What&#8217;s your favorite and why?**

My favorite is TV news because I like the format. It&#8217;s easy to understand. Dad likes TV because it&#8217;s more current and he likes to see the video segments.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news? </span>**

[KYW][10]&#8230; this is mom&#8230; and I like the [local FOX affiliate][11] because they seem more like real people&#8230;Dad says ditto.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

I remember the assassination of Martin Luther King because we were at my grandparents house for my grandfathers birthday. Dad says he remembers the Kennedy assassination.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

It will happen in a few days. My oldest son is getting married, can&#8217;t wait. Dad says the wedding and seeing his 3 kids together.

**7. Describe yourself a little bit.**

I am a down-to-earth easygoing happy person. My favorite role in life is being a mom. I love it! It has been so fulfilling and fun and I feel lucky to be a mom. Dad is an easy going guy. He loves to take photos of nature and loves gardening and feeding the birds. He pretty much loves anything in nature. He loves being a dad. He takes pride in telling &#8220;dad&#8221; type jokes and loves his kids&#8217; reactions! He loves what he does for a living and he feels lucky to have his life. 

**8. May I use your real name? First and last? Twitter handle?**

Robyn L Kramer&#8230;Neil R Kramer..[Robynkramer7][12]

**9. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.**

We live in Cherry Hill NJ.

** 10. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

I hate the repetitive format&#8230; The weather is not breaking news..it&#8217;s December..it&#8217;s cold..it snows.. This is not news. They lose me when the repeat the same things over and over.. I glaze over and don&#8217;t hear them&#8230;mom and dad.
