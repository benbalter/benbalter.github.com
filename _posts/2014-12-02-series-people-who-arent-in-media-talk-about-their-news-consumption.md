Today I&#8217;m starting a series where I ask people who don&#8217;t work in news &#8212; and don&#8217;t live in Washington D.C. or New York City &#8212; about their personal news consumption.

Meet my friend [Christine][1]. Christine lives in Philadelphia and has a knitting machine in her basement. She has the *best* taste in pop culture and has introduced me to many amazing TV shows and movies. She also thinks the Property Brothers are actually one person filming a Parent Trap-like movie. Christine is hilarious and a wonderful baker and just a great friend.

**1. How do you get your news?**

I like my news from the minority and I hate watching the news on TV, so I get my news exclusively on the internet. Mostly from [The Root][2], [Angry Asian Man][3], Â and [Code Switch][4].

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

I don&#8217;t know if this is appropriate but [this][5] is my favorite gif.

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Black.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

[Shaun King][6]&#8216;s twitter feed is my must read in the mornings.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Puerto Rico voting for Commonwealth status in 1992 or 1993. Then the OJ Simpson trial.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

Thanksgiving! Time with friends! Too much food!
