Meet [Brian][1]. He&#8217;s a father, husband, Wall Street IT Project Director, sports fan and musician (in roughly that order.) He&#8217;s also a really good career counselor and mentor for anyone who participated in the Penn Band. He&#8217;s an avid participant on our listserv, Oxymoron, and always willing and ready to lend a helping hand.

Brian, who tweets @[familygreenberg][2], was kind enough to answer some questions about how he gets his news. If you don’t work in news, live outside of DC/NYC, and would like to participate, let me know. (The rest of the series [is here][3].)

**1. How do you get your news?**

Web aggregators ([Google News][4], [My Yahoo][5], etc), Social Media (Facebook, Twitter), email from friends (Oxy) ([See here][6] for more on Oxy)

**2. What instrument do you play? **

Trumpet, Piano

**3. What do you think is the best middle name?**

My middle name is Michael and it has never let me down. I lack sufficient experience with other middle names to properly compare.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Complicated question. If it&#8217;s a story that requires specific expertise, I&#8217;ll look to sources I trust on that topic. If it&#8217;s a &#8220;Top Stories/National or International News&#8221; kind of story, I&#8217;ll usually stick with the big outlets, but will read multiple accounts of the same story to wash away the various errors and biases (especially if it&#8217;s political). So, for example, if Apple releases a new iPhone, I&#8217;ll probably look to [CNET][7] or [AppleInsider][8], but I would NEVER read about it in the [New York Times][9], because they are likely to get it 20-30% wrong. If Congress just passed a new law, though, I&#8217;ll read what the [Times][9] has to say, but then also click around and see what [Fox News][10] and [MSNBC][11] think, so I can draw my own conclusions about what&#8217;s really going on.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The US Bicentennial (1976).

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

My Dad came home from the hospital.

**7. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.**

Scotch Plains, NJ

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

&#8220;Hate&#8221; is a strong word. There&#8217;s never been so much information available in such real time. I dislike the emphasis on ratings/page views, which means it&#8217;s better to be first than to be right. I dislike that nothing is deemed interesting unless it&#8217;s entertaining, so people like Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and John Oliver can become people&#8217;s primary news sources, and brush off inaccuracies in their reporting with &#8220;we&#8217;re not the news, we&#8217;re just a comedy show.&#8221;

And I dislike that as a result, I have to constantly be my own editor. I&#8217;m just barely old enough to remember when journalists kept an audience by being consistently trustworthy and well-researched, not by &#8220;getting an exclusive interview with the latest person to commit a &#8220;gaffe,&#8221; or by choosing sides and then satirizing the other side into bumbling idiots or evil geniuses. If the Cronkites, Brokaws, Russerts, Jennings, etc. were tweeting, posting and updating today, I&#8217;d probably be more willing to read just one story and walk away feeling informed. Today&#8217;s model allows for more voices to be heard, which is great, but it requires more work on our part to stay truly informed.

Or, in less than 140 characters: With great power comes great responsibility.
