**1. How do you get your news?**

It depends on what kind of news it is &#8212; almost all of it is online. My general everyday news, comes from links on Facebook or Twitter. And [NPR][1] (on the radio) at the end of the day. For breaking news, its 100% Twitter &#8211; I have lists of journalists by topic that I follow as my go to sources. I find stories on twitter usually come out 2-3 days before they do on FB or anywhere else. Then I usually keep up with [Al Jazeera America][2] and [BBC][3]. For local news, its [MPBN][4] (radio) and [Bangor Daily News][5] online. Regional news, [Boston Globe][6] online. Art news, [artnet.com][7]; for tech it&#8217;s usually twitter. Oh and I&#8217;m enjoying [@nowthisnews][8] on Instagram. [I read / skim the paper when I&#8217;m at my parents house.]

**Ed note: She later sent this update:**

As I&#8217;m sitting here listening to Marketplace, I realize I try and listen to them everyday.   I guess I don&#8217;t think of them as &#8220;news&#8221; but I suppose it is?  And I also I really like the idea of <a href="http://www.beaconreader.com/" target="_blank">Beacon</a> and have enjoyed working with Dan Fletcher quite a bit over there.   But I don&#8217;t think of them as news either, more investigative journalism.  Is there a difference, do you think?  In my mind, news is current events.  But I suppose you could argue something like climate change is a current event.   Interesting to think about.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

Totally drawing a blank here. Doesn&#8217;t sitting quietly staring at this question for 5 minutes count as a poem? gif&#8217;s make me bonkers (probably why I avoid Tumblr)

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Just cream. As my friend Joe says, &#8220;The color of cardboard&#8221;

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I&#8217;m not sure I could name an organization that is doing it right. But, I think there are a groups of journalists that are (both photojournalists and writers). For instance during Ferguson, I was following [Matt Pearce][9], [Wesley Lowery][10] and [Christine Conetta][11]. They seemed to be working as a team even though they were covering for rivaling news outlets. They also were retweeting local news agencies and activists, which I thought showed respect for the community.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

[Samantha Smith][12]&#8216;s death. I remember the principal coming over the loud speaker (8th grade?) announcing a moment of silence. My recollection was she was about to be the first child astronaut and died on her way to being on a space shuttle. I was in public school in St. Louis at the time, but now I live in Maine where she was from. I just googled it to make sure I got her name right. According to Wikipedia (!), the plane she was in crashed in the little town I now live in. What a strange thing to discover. And also she was not on her way to becoming an astronaut. But she was still pretty awesome. **(Ed note: I had never heard of this. Read the [Wikipedia entry][12]. It&#8217;s fascinating.)**

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I had an acupuncture appointment that cured my photoshop hand / carpal tunnel.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

REPORTERS/PRODUCERS WHO DON&#8217;T FACT CHECK BEFORE THEY PUBLISH.

**8. What&#8217;s the best podcast or audio to listen to while doing chores?**

I&#8217;ve never been able to figure out a good system for podcasts so I don&#8217;t listen to them. I generally listen to music (NOLA brass bands are my go to) when I&#8217;m doing chores, except Sunday nights. Then I listen to [TAL][13] and [the Moth][14] while I&#8217;m cooking for the week.

**9. How do you get your news when you travel around the world?**

I&#8217;m terrible at keeping up on the news when I&#8217;m traveling, but if I do, it&#8217;s the same as when I&#8217;m at home: the internet. However, when I&#8217;m road tripping in the States, I love finding local NPR stations!
