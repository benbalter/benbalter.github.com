Meet [Beth Santos][1]. She&#8217;s the founder and CEO of [Go Girl Travel Network][2], a global network for women travelers. In her words, &#8220;I&#8217;m a spirited entrepreneur, a firm believer in teamwork and a lover of social enterprise. My background is in the international development space and I&#8217;ve lived around the USA as well as Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe and brief stints in Haiti. I&#8217;m currently enrolled in the evening program at Northwestern&#8217;s Kellogg School of Management, focusing on entrepreneurship + innovation and social enterprise.

Beth also sits on the board of [Chicago Adventure Therapy][3], an amazing non-profit that brings wilderness therapy to disadvantaged youth in urban environments. I asked Beth some questions about how she gets her news. If you’d like to read the others in the series, [please click here][4], and if you want to take part, just let me know.

**1. How do you get your news?**

Every morning, I walk into my office and turn my radio on. Radio! So old fashioned! It&#8217;s always set to [NPR][5], and even though this sounds like a cheesy opportunity to butter you up, it&#8217;s actually true. I have it playing all day long and listen while I work. Except over the holidays, when it&#8217;s on holiday music all day and I have no idea what is happening in the world.

I also keep up-to-date with things on Twitter and Facebook &#8212; it&#8217;s more or less my job to be on social media so I often catch current happenings as they come through.

Finally, I&#8217;m a diehard [Economist][6] subscriber. I read it on the train. Though it&#8217;s not as quick as radio or social media, it gives me an in-depth understanding of the world that you just can&#8217;t get in a tweet.

**3. How do you take your coffee? **

Extra cream, extra sugar, with a little bit of coffee in it. I pretty much drink my coffee like a five year old would, if five year olds drank coffee.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Considering I listen to [NPR][5] everyday, I should say that I love them. I also LOVE [Al Jazeera][7]. The stories they tell give me an incredibly rounded perspective, and I love how diverse they are and how they cover things that no one else covers. Of course, [The Economist][6] is great reading, and often really challenges my perspectives.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

I&#8217;m sure there are other things I remember, but something that really left an impression was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. So that everyone on the Internet world knows my age, I was 9 at the time, so I think it was one of the first times I really began to understand the media as a preteen. I remember standing in front of the TV and being fascinated by what was going on. I have a very clear image in my head of what the building looked like after the bombing.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I wish you had asked me about last week (or that I had answered this sooner)! Last week I was at the White House for their first-ever Travel Blogger Summit on study abroad and global exchange. It was an amazing event and I was so honored to be one of the 100 travel influencers selected to attend. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, we also got a puppy. This week, I think the most exciting thing that happened so far was that my husband brought home cupcakes from work.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

How negative it can be. I once told someone that if I ran the world, I would create a news station that only ran interesting/positive/non-negative news. He told me I&#8217;d never make money off of it. But a girl can dream.

**8. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**  
Obviously our own &#8220;[What She Said: Words from Women Travelers][8]&#8220;!

**9. How do you get your news when you travel around the world?**

I love to pick up a local paper wherever I go. I speak a few languages so can often figure things out when I travel. Nothing&#8217;s better than sitting in a cafe in a new place and reading the paper with the locals. In the case that I don&#8217;t speak the language and can&#8217;t puzzle it together, I rely on the Internet for my news, but often I try to keep my hands off the digital and just immerse myself locally as much as I can.
