I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the word pledge.

I&#8217;m watching WNYC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/series/bored-and-brilliant/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.wnyc.org/series/bored-and-brilliant/">Bored and Brilliant</a> campaign ask people to pledge to rethink their relationship with a smart phone. That&#8217;s smart.

I&#8217;m thinking about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">this Fresh Air interview</a> with Charles Duhigg, who writes about how habits form. I&#8217;m thinking about apps I&#8217;ve seen that create habit-forming triggers. I&#8217;m thinking about Kickstarter and New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. I&#8217;m thinking about pledge drives. I&#8217;m thinking a lot about the benefits of being a member of a larger group, and stating your affiliation publicly.

What if you could pledge to:

  * become a more engaged member of your community?
  * become more informed about a topic?
  * teach a member of your community something you learned today?
  * post news to social media that you valued?
  * have a conversation with someone about something you read online?
  * read at least one local story, one national story, and one international story per week.
  * read or listen to a piece of news about a local community that isn&#8217;t your own
  * think about the best thing you read last week?

How else can we think about pledging? And how might that change the way we build communities? I&#8217;m looking and thinking a lot about libraries, NASA, the National Parks, and the YMCA.

PS: Last year, a Georgia Tech researcher <a title="Georgia Tech" href="http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556" data-cke-saved-href="http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ice-gt/556">analyzed</a> which students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science in 2013. The researcher, Barbara Ericson, <a title="Education Week" href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/01/girls_african_americans_and_hi.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/01/girls_african_americans_and_hi.html">found</a> that in three states no women took it, in eight states no Hispanics did and in 11 states no blacks did. (In Mississippi only one person — not female, black or Hispanic, by the way — took the test that year. Oh, Mississippi.) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/opinion/charles-blow-a-future-segregated-by-science.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/opinion/charles-blow-a-future-segregated-by-science.html">nytimes.com</a>
