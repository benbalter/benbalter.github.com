Meet [Rob Shore][1]. By day, he&#8217;s a mild-mannered creative director who specializes in the public presentation of research findings. Outside of work, he co-founded a coworking space and [digital media collaborative][2], where he creates [hilarious films][3] and award-winning documentaries. He used to live in a yurt in Mongolia. He&#8217;s one of my favorite people to follow [on Instagram][4], in part because he travels all over the world.

When Rob&#8217;s not traveling, he&#8217;s based in DC. I was extremely glad when Rob said he would answer these questions. He was extremely enthusiastic about his willingness to participate: &#8220;Loving what you&#8217;re doing. Send telegram, email, phone number, or chloroform soaked handkerchief.&#8221;

We emailed. Rob answered. Here are his answers. If you&#8217;d like to participate, let me know. If you want to read the rest of the series, [click here][5].

**1. How do you get your news?**

I wake up and turn on [WAMU 88.5][6]. Jerry Edwards follows me into the bathroom and into the shower. It&#8217;s not as creepy as it sounds. Upon toweling, [Rachel Maddow][7] enters the picture. Just like she has every weekday morning for roughly six years. We have breakfast together. We cry, we learn. I think she thinks we laugh, but we don&#8217;t often. On the bus, it&#8217;s me and [Terry][8]. Sometimes the [New Yorker][9] if she&#8217;s had an off week. I no longer try to convince myself that the [Economist][10] is good for me. When I get to work I scan Facebook. I have a large and inaccurate number of friends, many of them who have been hidden because they have broken a complex and sacred set of rules that I have developed over the past decade. I have a perfectly curated little world: liberal, smoke, mirrors, memes, technology and cinephilia. Among all of my various feeds, services, readers, and aggregators ([Zite][11] is quite good), I actually have no better source for news that predictably entertains, educates, and delights me than my little self-selected group of 100 or so newsfeed fodder feeders. Call me old fashioned. Lunch is with [Jon][12] or, increasingly, with the newer, edgier [John][13].

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span**

**3. How do you take your coffee? **

Black, with cream.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

[Ezra Klein][15] is doing it right and doing it early and [doing it and doing and doing well][16]. Plus he&#8217;s reppin&#8217; Adams Morgan.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

I remember when the Challenger exploded. I guess I would have been four. I was at my friend Robert Reid&#8217;s house and my mother arrived to pick me up crying. Years later I went to the launch of the Columbia with my roommate Sumeet, whose aunt Kawlpana Chawla was on board. Needless to say, she never came back. It was a pretty devastating coda.

**6. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

Nancy Grace.
