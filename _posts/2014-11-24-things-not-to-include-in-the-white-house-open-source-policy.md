title: "Four things that shouldn't be in the White House open source policy"

### Things not to include in there

That said, there are three things I'd argue don't have a place in the White House open source policy. These are primarily things that, while the White House could certainly say to agencies, are subjects that the White House is far from the expert on, or even if potentially qualified, subjects that don't have established best practices, and thus are poorly suited for slow-moving government policy as the canonical source:

* **Making the case for open source** - There are [literally hundreds](http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html) of reasons to prefer open source. Unless specific to why *government* should use open source, there's likely nothing that can be said that hasn't already been said. Agencies would be better suited by the White House curating and validating those resources, rather than recreating them.

* **Best practices** - Similarly, there are [lots of resources](http://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Projects/Process+and+Compliance+Resources) around open source best practices, applicable to both small teams and large organizations. Again, unless *government-specific*, reinventing the wheel here would be anti-thetical to the policy itself.

* **Open source is secure** - For one, the security of open source software

If anything, there are some subjects that may be suited for separate implementation guidance that can be iterated on openly and quickly, without needing to go through the White House's formal policy-approval pipeline

* **Restating the law** - I've read the FAR. I'm not a fan of creating policy that simply restates law. It creates necessary complexity and slows implementation. Specifically, laws already exist that govern licensing of government created code. If created by government employees it's in the public domain and if created by contractors, the government gets unlimited rights, unless that right is negotiated away. If anything, implementation guidance can legitimize the practice of using CC0 to disambiguate rights internationally, and ensuring the government gets the necessary rights at the time of award.
