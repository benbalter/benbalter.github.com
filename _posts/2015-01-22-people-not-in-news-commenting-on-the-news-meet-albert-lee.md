Meet [Albert Lee][1], aka Mr. Philadelphia. Albert&#8217;s famous in Philly for his [Instagram][2] and [Twitter][3] feeds, on which he consistently and [fervently champions][4] the City of Brotherly Love. Albert works for the Visitor&#8217;s Center and grew up in Philly. When I lived there, I frequently bumped into him around town &#8212; because he was everywhere. South Philly, West Philly, out on Boathouse Row. His photography is consistently [top][5] [notch][6] &#8212; and he can answer basically any question you have about the 215.

I asked Albert a series of questions about how he gets his news. (If you’d like to read the others in the series, [please click here][7], and if you want to take part, just let me know.)

**1. How do you get your news?**

[KYW 1060AM][8]. It was my favorite radio station growing up because I loved hearing how schools were closed due to snow! I&#8217;m also a huge fan of getting my daily dose of happenings through my Facebook feed.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Tea for me. I am the only in my family who doesn&#8217;t drink coffee. I do however love the smell and those Folgers commercials.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Maybe because Brian Williams doesn&#8217;t mind slow jamming the news but I really do enjoy catching [his nightly broadcast][10] on NBC. I trust him.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The infamous white Ford bronco chase with O.J. Simpson.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I was asked to be the guest instagrammer for NYE and New Year&#8217;s Day for [VisitPhilly][11].

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

How they can be so opinionated when reporting news. It contributes to so much hate in the world. I understand world peace may never be an option but new stations love to start fires.

**11. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**

I actually have &#8220;Always Sunny in Philadelphia&#8221; on from Netflix as my background noise when doing chores..

**12. How do you get your news when you travel?**

[Twitter.][3] I don&#8217;t check twitter for news on my day to day only because a lot of my day is spent in front of my computer but when I&#8217;m out and about, I love using the chirping bird.
