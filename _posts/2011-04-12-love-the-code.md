I am gave a brief [lightning talk at April's WordPress DC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/events/16887732/) on the basics of HTML and PHP ("coding for dummies"). The goal: learn how to avoid breaking your website if you edit it. Below are the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/benbalter/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-code).

### The Cliff's Notes are

* The process

  * The server executes PHP and outputs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.![Screenshot of the presentation showing the relationship between server, browser, and user](http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/infographic-300x138.png "infographic"){: .alignright }
  * The user's browser takes that output and renders a visual representation of the page

* Client-side Languages

  * HTML – Static (unchanging) content; provides structure
  * CSS – Provides style and form
  * JavaScript – Provides interactivity

* PHP – Wrapped with "`php`" and "`?>`"

  * Variable - Text, a number, true/false, or a group of variable; identified by "`$`"
  * `If` Statement – performs an action *if* a statement is true
  * `While` Loop – performs an action *while* a statement is true
  * `For` / `Foreach` – combines elements of `while` and `if`
  * Functions – predefined set of actions; always followed by "`( )`"
  * Don't forget semicolons
