[DeVonna Johnson][1] is a marketing analyst and self-described social media geek who has three degrees, is studying for more degrees, and volunteers, reads, binge watches movies, and does aerial yoga. In her own words, she is a &#8220;hilarious, by-the-rules (only if I feel like they make sense) over-achiever who is very likely to integrate hashtags, song lyrics, and/or movie lines into everyday conversation.&#8221;

DeVonna, who tweets @[DeVonna_J][2], was kind enough to answer some questions about how she gets her news. If you&#8217;d like to participate and you don&#8217;t work in news, please let me know. To read others in the series, [click here][3].

**1. How do you get your news?**

I get most of my news from Social Media and my RSS feed (Feedly). Between Tumblr and Twitter, I&#8217;m always made aware of current events very soon after they take place. I subscribe to news sites such as NPR (my fave) in my RSS feed, so they keep me &#8220;in the know&#8221; as well.

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

See attachment.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m just being a smart-a** for using him, given the current spotlight on his &#8220;alleged&#8221; wrongdoings.

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

I don&#8217;t. I prefer tea. I collect it, in fact. <img src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Stephen Colbert, because despite being a male who experiences white privilege, he manages to acknowledge and remain informed about the plight of those who are not&#8230;.. while doing it in a satirical matter.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

When two young Black girls in Chicago, Diamond and Tionda Bradley, went missing. It was a really big deal because everyone pretty much knows that the girls&#8217; mother and her boyfriend were responsible for their disappearance but no one could prove it. Update: they&#8217;re still missing. They even made it onto an episode of TVOne&#8217;s show &#8220;[Find Our Missing][5].&#8221;

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

One of my best friends received word that he just got 2 Grammy nominations&#8230;.. And I had some delicious deep-dish pizza. #NomNom

**7. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.**

I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, but I currently reside in Oak Park, a western suburb.

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

I hate the tendency for news stations to always show the worst in African Americans while showing the best in non-POCs. I also hate how story lines and facts are skewed to better align with the stations stakeholders&#8217; interests.
