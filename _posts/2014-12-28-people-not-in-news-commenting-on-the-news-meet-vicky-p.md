Vicky P. is a Polish-born, English- and German-raised, US-educated English language teacher living in Berlin. She maintains an excellent Tumblr called [When You&#8217;re A Third Culture Kid][1]. She&#8217;s really good at the Internet.

Vicky was kind enough to answer some questions about how she gets her news. If you donâ€™t work in news, live outside of DC/NYC, and would like to participate, let me know. (Rest of series is [here][2])

**1. How do you get your news?**

[The Skimm][3], Facebook, tumblr, [bbc.com][4], my students

**2. What instrument do you play? **

currently none (past: saxophone, drums, piano)

**3. What do you think is the best middle name?**

Elizabeth for a girl, Slagathor for a boy.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Late night talk show hosts &#8212; with humor. Tumblr &#8212; with conviction and passion (and a lot of teen angst). Anything that&#8217;s easily shared.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Princess Diana&#8217;s death (I was living in Manchester, England at the time and, on the day of her funeral, was wondering why no one was outside playing)

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

Someone told me I was wonderful.

**7. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.**

Berlin, Germany, Europe, the Northern Hemisphere, the World, the Solar System, etc. etc.

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

Sensationalist reporting and the clamoring of news agencies to be the first to break the story&#8211;whether or not they have all the facts.
