Meet [Margot Harrington][1]. She designed and built the website you&#8217;re reading right now. How cool is that? She runs her own graphic and web [design firm][1] in Chicago, makes art, and likes bright colors. She also coordinates a design conference in Cleveland called [Weapons of Mass Creation][2]. This was one of the first non-news conferences I&#8217;ve gone to, and I found myself inspired and learning quite a bit from people who think in different ways. Designers are great.

In Margot&#8217;s own words, &#8220;I have short hair (for now) and sometimes I wear glasses. I&#8217;m about 60/40 intro and extraverted. I like yoga and active things which I never thought I&#8217;d say because I hated most sports as a kid. I&#8217;m a graphic and web designer, and a sometimes teacher and writer and artist. Can I make something for you?&#8221;

Margot, who tweets @[pitchdesign][3], answered lots of questions about how she gets her news. (If you’d like to participate, please let me know. To read the rest of the series, [click here][4].)

**1. How do you get your news?**

Twitter, I stream [WBEZ][5] on my iPhone from their mobile app, and Facebook for local stuff. Also, [Jon Stewart][6]. I don&#8217;t frequent [BBC][7] or [Al Jazeera][8] as often, but I will when I&#8217;m looking for specific updates on stories that&#8217;ve been sensationalized on regular American networks.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

[This][9] is one of [Lili Carré][10]&#8216;s moving drawings. She&#8217;s one of my favorite artists.

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

I drink it any way it come, no preference. I just can&#8217;t have much more than half a cup. Is it brown? Does it have caffeine? Okay, done. I also like tea equally as much.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Honestly, I don&#8217;t know if there is one right outlet. I have the most respect for news on the radio since we don&#8217;t own a TV and I find most news networks or local news shows hokey and trying too hard. [WBEZ][5], [MPR][11], [WNYC][12], and [WHYY][13] are the only radio networks I seek out.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Probably when 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling was abducted from St. Joseph, Minnesota (I grew up in St. Paul, MN) in 1989. That was in local news for weeks and weeks and there was a lot of talking to kids about stranger danger. After that I think the first national news story I remember was OJ Simpson, especially since he used to play for the MN Vikings.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I get to see both my parents, my sister, my two baby nieces, and some old friends from childhood!

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

The 24 hour news cycle! It&#8217;s the root of the sensationalism and overwrought news stories. They are constantly in a state of having to outdo themselves and make everything into breaking news even when nothing new has happened. Also they&#8217;re trying to keep up with social media which is impossible, so why even try?

**8. What&#8217;s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?**

Hmmm. Well if I&#8217;m cleaning I like to listen to a podcast that&#8217;s information heavy like [Professor Blastoff][14], [Stuff Mom Never Told You][15], or of course everyone&#8217;s favorite [Radiolab][16].

**9. How do you get your news when you travel?**

Same, just whatever is on my phone. If it&#8217;s a car trip sometimes flipping through the local channels to find the local npr or non-conservative station.
