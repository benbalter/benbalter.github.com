[Adam Sherr][1] is a West Philadelphia native and the assistant director of the Penn Band. He is one of those people who cannot walk a block in Philadelphia without seeing a dozen people he knows.

Adam and I are on a listserv together called Oxymoron. Oxymoron is the private listserv for people who have been in the [Penn Band][2]. There are hundreds of people on the listserv and we live all over the world and we all have different careers. I receive hundreds of emails from Oxy, as it&#8217;s called, in an average week. And it is by far my best and most trusted news source. Whenever there&#8217;s breaking news, I go to Oxy because a) I know the discussion will be really good and b) I want to see what my friends think. Oxy is also a great way to find housing, find a job, find a good place to eat, or just comment on anything, really. It&#8217;s like a private version of Reddit and Craig&#8217;s List and Google News. (Something to think about.)

Adam was kind enough to answer some questions about how he gets his news. If you don&#8217;t work in news, live outside of DC/NYC, and would like to participate, let me know. (Rest of series [is here][3])
