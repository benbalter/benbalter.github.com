Meet [Ellen Chisa][1]. She&#8217;s currently a business student at Harvard, which she says leaves her with a lot of time to read about interesting businesses but far less time to read things she wants to. In January, she&#8217;s heading to Indonesia for a month to work at a cereal company. She teaches [product management classes][2], grew up in Michigan, and has a cat named [Gu][3]. In her own words, &#8220;Personally&#8230; I&#8217;m super introverted. I&#8217;m happier reading and writing than I am interacting with people &#8211; and I&#8217;ve finally figured out that ideally I want to work for 4-5 hours, talk to someone for an hour or two, and repeat. It&#8217;s hard to make that work at business school!

Ellen, who tweets @[ellenchisa][4], was kind enough to answer some questions about how she gets her news. If you don&#8217;t work in news and would like to participate, please let me know. To read how other people get their news, [click here][5].

**1. How do you get your news?**

[The Skimm][6].  At one point I realized I got \*no\* normal news, and this was the quickest summary I could find, and it was new at the time. I just like signing up for new news. Fear of missing out.

[Today in Tabs][7]! The other 50 Tinyletters I get as a result of my &#8220;friends&#8221; are relegated into my newsletters tab (742 unread). [Tabs][7] is the only one that&#8217;s still allowed in my inbox, though, and I read it every day.

[ Twitter.][4] I&#8217;m generally pretty happy with the people I follow. They do a good job of keeping me up on news. It runs the gamut from actual articles from the [New York Times][8] or [Wall Street Journal][9] to private blogs on specific topics.

For Tech news: [Stratechery][10]. I&#8217;m pretty sure this is the only news I actually pay for. It&#8217;s $10 a month and extremely thoughtful &#8211; rather than just &#8220;so and so bought whoever&#8221; it&#8217;s an actual thoughtful analysis.

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

([Steve Ballmer cake gif][11]) I almost never watch videos, I get bored halfway through (and permanently leave my laptop on mute).

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Lately, black. It depends a lot on: who I&#8217;m drinking the coffee with, how good the coffee is, and how hot the coffee is.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I have to go with Ben Thompson from [Stratechery][10] again. I really like the high-quality specific vertical. I also keep wanting to subscribe to [The Information][12], but it&#8217;d be $399/year, which is a bit steep given I&#8217;m back in school.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

This is embarrassing, but I don&#8217;t really remember. I think probably something about the auto companies. I grew up in Detroit and I remember being shocked to learn that not every paper covers Ford, GM, and Chrysler every day. I also remember going to the news station in elementary school and getting to pretend I was the weatherperson.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

It hasn&#8217;t happened quite yet, but I&#8217;ve spent all week looking forward to this evening. I&#8217;m going to a curator talk on the creation of the [Goya exhibit][13] at the MFA. Last week I went to explore the exhibit on my own time, and I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing about the decisions they made while putting it together! I often like seeing how things are made more than I like seeing the output.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

It feels transient. Something happens, I get an update, and then it&#8217;s gone. I feel like I almost never understand the resolution &#8211; it&#8217;s just like &#8220;oh it&#8217;s news!&#8221; followed by a slow fade to nothing.
