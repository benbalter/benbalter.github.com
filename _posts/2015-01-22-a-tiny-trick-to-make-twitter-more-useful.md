Did you know that you can add a column to Tweetdeck that shows you either what people are looking at or what they&#8217;ve favorited? It&#8217;s fairly simple and I find it adds a lot of value (particularly if you&#8217;re a reporter or trying to do research within a certain industry.)

Here&#8217;s how:

1. Open Tweetdeck.  
2. Search for a person.  
3. Click on Favorites (to see what they favorite) or Home (to see what they see)  
4. Click Add column.  
5. Voila!

Here&#8217;s a screenshot indicating what I mean:
