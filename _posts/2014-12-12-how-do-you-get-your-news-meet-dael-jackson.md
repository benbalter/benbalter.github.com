Meet [Dael Jackson][1]. She is 32 and runs the box office at a theater department at a Catholic college. She’s a newly-minted MBA and she loves to travel. In her words: “I find it so relaxing to remove myself from everything I know and love to get to know other cultures. I took a second job a bit over a year ago specifically because it offered me the option to travel abroad sometimes. The job itself is really rewarding and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d give it up now, but the original selling point was absolutely the travel. Most recently I was in South Korea. It&#8217;s an amazing country with kind people, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever felt safer as a women and a foreigner. Between my bad chopstick skills and being a vegetarian, I was really sick of bread and kimchi by the end of the week, though. \*^-^\* I love to go hiking and read as well, both of which I get to do a bit more since I&#8217;m not independently wealthy. They both serve as an escape from daily life, which is something I really appreciate since my job is pretty stressful.”

Dael, who tweets @[honestturtle][1], was kind enough to answer some questions about her news consumption for my series “[How Do You Get Your News?][2]” If you’d like to participate, let me know.

**1. How do you get your news?**

I have a pretty wide number of places I get my news. On TV I watch CBS in the morning before work (local for a half hour and national for a half hour) and The Daily Show & Colbert at night. Driving to and from work I listen to NPR, about an hour of time total. If there&#8217;s a particular story I want to learn more about, I&#8217;ll use BBC or Al Jazeera online and recently I&#8217;ve been turning to Tumblr and Reddit more for stories that I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m getting the full picture on.

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

After thinking way too long, the best fit I can think of is [this video][3].

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

If possible, with peppermint creamer. If not, milk and a splenda.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

One person that&#8217;s really impressed me lately on Tumblr is the person who writes [I Write About Feminism][4]. Despite the blog title, she&#8217;s been doing an amazing job with the Michael Brown shooting. She does a lot of content aggregation from those on the front line and answers a lot of questions from her followers. Also, she loudly and publicly admits it when she gets something wrong, which is something I find amazing in a person and in a media source. The other thing that I&#8217;ve recently fallen in love with is [bit-of-news][5]. I usually know their top stories, but the second set of longer reads is a must for me most of the time because they&#8217;re so interesting and eclectic. (**Mel note: **[See here][6] for more about bit of news.)

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The Berlin Wall falling. I remember thinking how strongly those people must feel to literally rip out pieces of concrete.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

On Thanksgiving I got to feed my 7-week-old niece her bottle. The way she looked at me while she ate was just breath-taking.

**7. Where do you live?**

Emmaus, PA

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

That I no longer feel like anywhere will give me the whole story. Instead it&#8217;s what fits in a short segment and is often aimed to confirm their audience&#8217;s existing viewpoints. I think it&#8217;s so easy to leap to wrong conclusions and the news doesn&#8217;t often serve as a balance to that like I think (or maybe just wish) it should.

Thanks for this. Its been really interesting to actually think about how I consume news!
