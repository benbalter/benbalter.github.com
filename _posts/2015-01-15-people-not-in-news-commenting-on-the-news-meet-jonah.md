Meet [Jonah Sutton-Morse][1]. He&#8217;s a stay-at-home dad with two daughters (preschool-aged and an almost-toddler) and lives in a Chicago suburb. I met Jonah on Twitter, where he spends a lot of time &#8220;trying to figure out suburban Chicago stay-at-home Dad socializing.&#8221;

Jonah still gets a lot of his news from public media. &#8220;I grew up on [Minnesota Public Radio][2] [and listened to] [A Prairie Home Companion][3] and [Sound Money][4], along with [Car Talk][5] and [All Things Considered][6],&#8221; he says.

Jonah was kind to answer some questions about how he gets his news. If you’d like to read the others in the series, [please click here][7], and if you want to take part, just let me know.

**1. How do you get your news? Please answer in a haiku or limerick. Your choice.**

Do numbers with [Kai][8]  
People on Twitter Share Stuff  
NPR in Cars

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

I don&#8217;t really understand animated gifs, but kids are distracting and wonderful. [Does this work? ][9] **(Ed note: Yes.)**

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

Black, from a Chemex or Aeropress because coffee is about rituals and spilling grounds.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

[Marketplace][10]. They always have a consistent angle, which means even when they&#8217;re doing the story of the day or week it&#8217;s worth a listen. Plus Kai Rysdall is a great interviewer, especially when talking to random small business people around the country.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

In second grade I remember switching to a new school and seeing a newspaper clipping criticizing the first Iraq war. I also remember the &#8220;Save the Whales&#8221; and &#8220;I saw the wall fall&#8221; buttons. I definitely remember those buttons & knowing it was the Berlin Wall and Important. That was a couple years earlier but I don&#8217;t really remember specific events.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

My 3 1/2 year old told me that the story of Bilbo Baggins the Burglar Hobbit that is been telling in the car was pretty good & we should make a book, so she started drawing scenes from The Hobbit. Either that or her little sister climbing up stairs.

**7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

I hate the extent to which news seems more about covering what everyone is covering than digging into stories & context that need to be told. But then, other than whatever NPR stories get highlighted in Twitter/NPR One, all I see of the news are headlines people link to that I ignore, so maybe I&#8217;m wrong? Margaret Sullivan&#8217;s column suggests to me that even news insiders think there are a lot of newsworthy stories not being covered.
