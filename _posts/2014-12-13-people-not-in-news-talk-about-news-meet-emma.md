What can I say about [Emma][1]? We met in Philadelphia, after we had both gotten out of relationships and I was consoling myself by taking up extreme exercise (6am Crossfit) and she was consoling herself by launching and then running [a very successful website][2] about why she and [others][3] love the city of Philadelphia. She still runs the website. I no longer do Crossfit.

Emma and I [participated][4] (SFW) in the Philadelphia Naked Bike Ride together, which still remains one of the most joyous and fun things I have ever done. Emma is a [papercutter][5]/[lasercutter][6]. She basically runs the Philadelphia waterfront. She plans events and makes things happen and still finds lots of time in her life to be a great friend and [make amazing things][7].

Emma was kind enough to answer a series of questions about how she takes her news for my series &#8220;[How Do You Get The News?][8]&#8221; If you&#8217;d like to participate, let me know.

**1. How do you get your news? **

Social media (Twitter for headlines, Instagram for things going on, Facebook for stupid fun things), Feedly tracks all the blogs I search for waterfront related issues, [NYTimes][9], and [Philly Mag][10]&#8216;s emails.

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

[This is me][11] perusing Feedly. You can also hear my crazy (awesome) coworker in the background who is so, so, so loud.

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

With a terrible stomach ache, so I usually drink tea. Both tea and coffee are just cream and sugar delivery vehicles.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I get stuck in news ruts. I love my podcasts &#8212; [This American Life][12], [RadioLab][13], [Planet Money][14], [Ted Radio Hour][15]. I&#8217;ve literally listened to every single episode of those. Just recently got into [On the Media][16], and that&#8217;s definitely one of my main sources of news. I think their conversations are enlightening and timely, though I always wonder why, at the end, they always say&#8230; &#8220;Brooke (Bob) has off this week.&#8221; It makes it seem like they&#8217;re always on vacation. Philly news would be [Philly Mag][10]&#8216;s digital side. It&#8217;s not overwhelming, it&#8217;s well categorized, smart writers (need more women), has some serious, some pop stuff. And [NYTimes][9]. Of course. I still romanticize my Sunday mornings with the print NYTimes and a cup of coffee (and the inevitable stomach ache). Oh, and [Frontline][17]. I don&#8217;t watch TV or Netflix really, but I will catch up with that show.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Oh god. The Oklahoma City Bombing. Maybe. I don&#8217;t know. And OJ Simpson. Which came first?

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

In the last seven days we opened up [Blue Cross RiverRink Winterfest][18], and I was reminded that I work for an organization that is doing great things for the city.

**7. Where do you live? **

Philly

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

Comments sections, too much to consume &#8212; as silly as it sounds, I do not have enough time and I want someone to give me a good aggregator (I do love [longform.org][19])
