Meet [Ashe Dryden][1]. She&#8217;s a computer programmer from Oregon who frequently [consults][2] with organizations on diversity issues. Outside of work, she knits. &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I wanted to pick up a hobby that got me away from my computer,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m a programmer by trade and much of the socializing I was doing at the time was over the internet, mostly with men. Knitting was something creative I could do with my hands while hanging out in a woman-dominated space.&#8221;</span>

I asked Ashe a series of questions about how she gets her news. If you&#8217;d like to participate, let me know. (Previous interviews [here][3].)

**1. How do you get your news? This is open-ended on purpose.**

Through twitter mostly. I also read the news mostly-daily on [Colorlines][4] and [Al Jazeera English][5].

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.**

[Here.][6]

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

A glass of almond milk with a splash of coffee in it.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

I honestly have been enjoying much more investigative journalism and in-depth pieces than I have outright news. I love the work of [Shaun King][7], who has been writing a lot about civil rights violations and the embedded racism surrounding the murder of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

The LA riots.

**6. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

There is no major effort to educate people to understand the context behind world events, if anything there is an intentional effort to mislead people to align with their worldview.

**7. What&#8217;s the best podcast or audio to listen to while doing chores?**

I listen to [This American Life][8], [RadioLab][9], and NPR&#8217;s [Planet Money][10].

**8. How do you get your news when you travel around the world?**

Same ways. Everything is digital these days, so I can read whatever wherever, even translating things into English if I need to.
