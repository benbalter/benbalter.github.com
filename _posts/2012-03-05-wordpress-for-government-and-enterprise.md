title: WordPress for Government - A Problem of Perception
description: Among potential government and enterprise users, WordPress has a perception problem especially when compared to Drupal and other "serious" CMSs.

Over the past several years WordPress's market share has enjoyed explosive growth across virtually every industry. Today, it powers [nearly a quarter of new sites](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/wordpress-now-powers-22-percent-of-new-active-websites-in-the-us/), and is the CMS of choice for [more than two thirds of the top-million sites](http://trends.builtwith.com/cms) on the web making it the world's most popular publishing platform by a long shot. Yet one group of seemingly ideal users has been slow to take the former blogging platform seriously: .govs.

Drupal powers twice as many federal .govs as every other CMS combined. That's more than six Drupal sites for every one WordPress .Gov alone, not to mention the Joomlas, MovableTypes, and SharePoints of the world. The build-it-yourself software powers the White House, the House of Representatives, half a dozen agencies, and countless data-driven microsites like Recovery.gov and the IT Spending Dashboard, and its public sector use is [equally if not more impressive abroad](http://groups.drupal.org/node/19885).

## A Problem of Perception

### Typical Enterprise Misconceptions

- WordPress is a blogging platform
- WordPress doesn't scale well
- Most plugins are written by hobbyists, not professionals
- WordPress is less secure
- WordPress can't handle complex data types or user roles
- There's no enterprise support
- There aren't many WordPress developers
- No "serious" people use WordPress
- The WordPress codebase is immature

WordPress's disproportionately low government adoption is arguably the result of a handful of factors. For one, custom post types, the feature that formally graduated WordPress from a mere blogging platform into a full-fledged content management system, has only been around since June of last year. Yet, even among new sites,[^1] the ratio remains somewhat stagnant, if not shrinking, leaving one to believe that the technology has lapped its own already stellar perception.

When you stack the two side by side (or against any other CMS for that matter), WordPress is objectively the prudent choice. On paper, you'd be hard-pressed to make the case for anything else. But, it's not a technical problem. It's a human one. It seems that WordPress's greatest asset – ease of use that has resulted in widespread adoption by a largely non-technical user base – is threatening to become its greatest liability.

Among those empowered to make purchasing decisions, there seems to be a sense that WordPress is what you use on the weekends to post pictures of your lunch while Drupal is what you use for "serious" business, and with good reason. For better or for worse, Drupal has positioned itself as not just a CMS, but rather *the* enterprise solution — an inseparable fifth layer of the increasingly ubiquitous enterprise LAMPD stack.

## **Beyond Cowboy Coders**

Not surprisingly, the two communities are a reflection of their underlying software's position in the broader market. CodePoet.com, for example, a directory of WordPress consultants curated by Automattic, lists [a mere thirteen firms in North America that seek jobs over $250,000](http://codepoet.com/browse/regions/north-america/platforms/wordpress/project-size/250000-250000/)(often a small price tag for government or corporate sites), while its Drupal counterpart lists roughly 80 firms that specifically target [government](https://drupal.org/drupal-services/all/Government), [enterprise](https://drupal.org/drupal-services/all/Enterprise), and [NGO clients](https://drupal.org/drupal-services/all/Non-profit) daily.

I am not suggesting that freelance developers should bring an end to what makes WordPress and change out of their shorts and sandals this instant or that they become intimately familiar with the nuances of federal procurement law, nor am I suggesting that small shops seek to bite off more than they can realistically chew anytime soon. I am suggestion, however, that there are small, tangible steps that the community can take to make headway into the government and enterprise space and gradually entrench WordPress as a viable alternative to otherwise subpar software harming innocent public servants.
