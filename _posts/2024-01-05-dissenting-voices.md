title: The "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach to crisis management
description: Leaders often face push back when they make tough decisions. Trying to "control the narrative" by ignoring or shutting down dissent is a bad idea. It erodes trust, invites negativity, and stifles learning. A better approach is to be transparent, open, and accountable. This builds trust, invites positivity, and fosters learning.

Every seasoned leader I've worked with has had to make an unpopular or controversial decision. It's one of the hallmarks of good leadership. But almost as important as the decision itself, is how you engage with your team following it.

It's understandable. You spend days, weeks, maybe months agonizing over ever detail, every pro and con, every possible outcome. You've done your due diligence, and you've made the best decision you can given the situation. You're confident in your decision, and you're ready to move forward. Then comes the inevitable push back.

It's easy to dismiss that negativity as ignorant or personal ("you can't please everyone"), after all, they have a fraction of the perspective you have as a leader. You might seek to "control the narrative", by dismissing such voices as inviting negativity, undermining your authority, or asking questions that you've already answered, thinking its unproductive to further discuss a decision you know is  final. Those are all understandable and human reactions.

## "Controlling the narrative" is counterproductive

Attempting to "control the narrative" by silencing dissent is not only ineffective, it's also counterproductive:

* **It erodes trust** - When you shut down the conversation, you send a message that you don't value the input, the perspective, or the feelings of those affected by your decision. You also signal that you have something to hide, or that you're not confident in your own reasoning. This undermines your credibility and your relationship with your stakeholders, who may lose faith in your judgment, your integrity, or your competence.
* **It invites negativity** - When you ignore the questions, you don't make them go away. You just push them underground, where they fester and grow. People will start to speculate, gossip, and complain. They will feel resentful, frustrated, and alienated. They will look for ways to resist, sabotage, or undermine your decision. They will also lose respect for you, and for the organization that allows you to act this way.
* **It stifles learning** - When you avoid the scrutiny, you miss an opportunity to improve your decision, your process, or your outcome. You don't get to hear the different perspectives, the alternative solutions, or the constructive feedback that could help you refine your thinking, address the gaps, or mitigate the risks. You also don't get to learn from your mistakes, your assumptions, or your blind spots. You end up repeating the same errors, or making new ones, without realizing it.

## "Caremad" is a good thing

Your team's reaction is equally human, and I'd argue, actually a good thing.[^1] It means their engaged. It means they care. While you're ready to move on, they're still processing. They're still trying to understand. The difference between good leaders and great leaders is in the follow through. Specifically, in their willingness to engage in the *emotional labor* of helping their team figure out how to move forward.

That dissent isn't disengagement or obstructionism as it may be easy to misread. Quite the opposite. They're likely "caremad"[^2] - they're upset because they care about ensuring the best possible outcomes and are trying to figure out how to do that. The reality is, questions and dissenting voices are a sign that people care about the decision being made. They want to understand the reasoning behind it and they want to have a say in the process. And as a leader, it's your job to listen to those voices and to take their concerns into account.

## The alternative

The best leaders I've worked with have always been open to dissenting voices. They've always been willing to listen to the other side of the argument, and to engage with it. They've always been willing to change their mind. The answer is simple: be transparent, open, and accountable. This means:

* **Be transparent** - Share the information, the data, and the evidence that informed your decision. Explain the criteria, the trade-offs, and the implications. Acknowledge the limitations, the uncertainties, and the challenges. Don't hide, spin, or sugarcoat the facts. Be honest, clear, and consistent.
* **Be open** - Invite the questions, the feedback, and the dialogue. Listen to the concerns, the objections, and the suggestions. Respond with respect, empathy, and curiosity. Don't dismiss, deflect, or attack the views. Be receptive, humble, and collaborative.
* **Be accountable** - Take responsibility for your decision, your actions, and your results. Admit the mistakes, the failures, and the consequences. Apologize, correct, and improve. Don't blame, deny, or justify the faults. Be humble, courageous, and adaptive.

The alternative to the "I don't like what they're saying so they shouldn't be allowed to say it" approach is to embrace transparency, openness, and accountability. This means acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of the situation, explaining the rationale and evidence behind your decision, inviting and addressing the questions and concerns of your stakeholders, and admitting and correcting any errors or shortcomings. This also means being humble and curious, listening and learning from others, and being willing to change your mind or course of action when warranted. This also means being clear and consistent, communicating frequently and honestly, and following through on your commitments and promises.

## Conclusion

In fact, I would argue that covering one's ears and humming in the face of questions shows a lack of leadership in the moment. It's the equivalent of saying "I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you mangy kids..." (a reference to Scooby Doo, for those of you who didn't grow up watching Saturday morning cartoons).

[^1]: I'd take an engaged team that can have healthy, productive, and respectful disagreement any day over a team that's checkout out, indifferent, or apathetic. If they don't care enough about this thing to speak up, it's likely that there are other, bigger things that they're not speaking up about either.

A caremad developer is not satisfied with mediocrity, but strives for excellence, innovation, and continuous improvement. For example, "She's caremad about accessibility, she always makes sure every feature is compatible with screen readers and keyboard navigation."
