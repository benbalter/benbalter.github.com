I end up traveling a fair amount for work. Being in an unfamiliar city, in an unfamiliar time zone, your hotel room can often be the only place of refuge on an otherwise disorienting day of travel. Having experience some of the best and the worst in terms of guest experience, here's nine things every hotel room should have (and one bonus):

## 1. Signposts

When I get off the elevator, the first thing I see should be a sign directing me to my room. If there's one thing a hotel can safely assume, it's that I've never stayed there before. Should I turn left? Should I turn right? Am I even on the right floor? 1-10 is that way? Great. Now I know don't have to walk half way down the wrong hallway, before returning to the elevator to do it all again. Point me in the right direction.

Bonus points: Signposts in the elevator. Was the gym on two or three? Especially if registration is on a floor other than one, labeled buttons or a sign above the control panel goes a long way to decrease uncertainty.

## 2. Outlets

It's the 21st century. I'm going to be traveling with at least one, and likely more than one device that has a  battery, and thus needs to be charged. Desk outlets should be immediately visible, at waist level, not beside, under, or even worse, behind the desk. Having a fancy outlet built into the lamp or desk is fine, but make sure it's large enough for an adapter or two to fit. Whatever you do, don't make me hunt for the outlets. This isn't Where's Waldo.

Bonus points: A charging station with USB outlets or adaptors for common connectors. Everyone forgets their charger at least once. (although be ware, as public charging stations may not be as trustworthy as you think).

## 3. A single light switch

This seems to be more common in Europe, but I don't need a multi-faceted lightscape to sleep, shower, and dress. Give me a single switch, with dual controls next to the door and bed, with three positions, on, dim, and off. Even if I've stayed at this hotel before, the hotel can assume I've never stayed in this room, and I shouldn't have to spend half my time in the room searching for switches, knobs, and dials. Is it on the wall? The base of the lamp? The floor? the top? http://i.imgur.com/x9j2aGz

Bonus Points: The switch requires my room key to work. I always know where my key is, and as soon as I leave, the room goes dark. We all win.

## 4. Channel lineup and remote next to the TV

There's only one channel I watch when I travel, the news. I want to stay connected to the world, but th enumber's never the same. I shouldn't have to hunt through a 300-page hotel room user-manual, which also has the prices for dry cleaning and the room service menu. Place a small, laminated placard with the local channel line up, next to the TV, along with the remote so I can immediately get to my stories.

Bonus points: If I don't have to deal with some proprietary, 24-7 hotel informercial delivery system before I can access a real channel. I turn on the TV and there's TV? Crazy talk.

## 5. WiFi (that's faster than dialup)

I get that you're trying to turn a profit, but if you advertise free "in room WiFi" and "broadband internet", it shouldn't be tantamount to an Internet experience I had when I was still on AOL. Dialup speed does not a broadband internet make, nor does an overloaded access point, struggling to stay below 50% packet loss. Either invest in a great infrastructure, which I'd gladly pay for, or provide free internet, but don't oversell it.

Bonus points: Offer free (actually) broadband WiFI under a freemium model, and let me upgrade if I need it. Even more bonus points if your captive portal is responsive and unobtrusive.

## 6. A Safe

I travel with a lot of electronics (see #2), many of which I don't need when I leave the room for the day. I've seen doors left wide open while the room's being cleaned, and can immagine plenty of "oh that's my room" stories, or even double booking mixups. I can hide things in [redacted], but best to provide a bolted down lock-box for me to store valuables. Better yet, make sure it's wide enough to fit a laptop.

Bonus points: Accept drivers licenses or credit cards as a form of authentication. Even more bonus points, place an electrical outlet inside the safe so I can charge things while I'm out.

## 7. Water

I'm your guest. If I came to your house or place of business, and asked for water, would you give it to me? Of course. It's only considerate. It doesn't need to be fancy (I'm not asking for water from a melted glacier), but anything bottled (or even just a real glass for tap water) will suffice in most cities. Planes and hotel rooms are notoriously dry and every drop you can get when traveling counts.

Bonus points:

## 8. Ample counter space

Everyone has their routine. I'd like to think mine's on the simpler side (hotel shampoo, what's conditoiner?), but even then, everyone travels with a certain amount of "product". I don't need a dedicated makeup vanity, but the bathroom sink should be more than simply a water catcher. Give me enough space for at least a toothbrush, toothpase, and a contact case. The more the better.

Bonus points:

## 9. A mirror

You can assume I'm going to someplace where people are going to see me. That's kinda the whole point of traveling. A mirror that's three feet away and only shows the waist up doesn't cut it. Mirrored closet doors, a full-length mirror in the hallway, heck, even a mirror by the elevator in a pinch, but I need an early warning if my suitcase has taken a toll on that once-ironed shirt.

Bonus: A well-lit mirror that I can get close to. It can be one of those self-lit, magnifying mirrors, or even just a mirror on a well-lit wall, but when I want to see just how bad the bags under my eyes are from last-night's red eye, I should be able to.

## A bonus: Implicit negative floor real estate

Nearly every hotel room you've been in has had a plot of implicit negative floor real estate, reserved for you to put your suitcase. Often this is between the TV and the closet or bathroom, or sometimes under the window, depending on the layout. Trust me you'll notice when it's not there. When laying out the room, lay out a place for me to put my luggage, and make it clear at first glance. Just as you would a bedroom, think through the daily flow and plan accordingly.

I'm not saying you shouldn't stay at any hotel that doesn't get a 10/10, far from it, but if you're designing a hotel room for the modern traveler, here's what's on my list. What's on yours?
