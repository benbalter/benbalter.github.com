Meet [Nikki Lee][1]. She studied engineering in <a href="http://olin.edu/" target="_blank">college</a> and human-computer interaction in <a href="http://hcde.washington.edu/" target="_blank">grad school</a>. She gets paid to product manage digital pen experiences for Windows and in her spare time she runs the <a href="http://awesomeseattle.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Awesome Foundation</a> and works on personal informatics research projects. She likes video games and riding bikes. She says that she is &#8220;profoundly introverted, but enjoy[s] public speaking and meeting new people.&#8221; And she gave away [12,000$ to charity][2] and her friends picked the charities. Pretty awesome.

Nikki, who tweets @[nkkl][3], was kind enough to answer some questions about her news consumption for my series “[How Do You Get Your News?][4]” If you’d like to participate, let me know.

**1. How do you get your news? Please answer in a haiku or limerick. Your choice.**

I really did try  
[Quartz][5] and [Circa][6] and [The Skimm][7]  
It&#8217;s still too much work

**2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.**

[This][8] is a pretty good average. The full range is about 1 second to 3-4 hours, so that tells you how many things land in the 1 second bucket&#8230;

**3. How do you take your coffee?**

I like my women like I like my coffee: not really my thing.

**4. Who&#8217;s doing it right in news?**

Maybe no one? [Al Jazeera][9] is good for when you want to actually know things and are a responsible adult. Twitter and Reddit (the user bases, not the companies) are really good at amplifying and spreading messages, so I usually hear about important events that way.

**5. What&#8217;s the first news event that you remember?**

Probably 9/11 &#8211; and I was a teenager at the time, so that mostly says something about my memory.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?**

I flew home for Thanksgiving and got to see my parents, brother, grandmother, and cat. Plus, my mom made me cookies!

**7. Where do you live? **

Seattle!

**8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?**

It&#8217;s too hard to figure out what&#8217;s actually important. Sensationalism and boring minutiae drown out meaningful stories, and when something big does come along, it&#8217;s often presented with so little context that I can&#8217;t figure out what&#8217;s happening or how it relates to anything else. Trying to follow actual news alternates between boring and baffling. News that&#8217;s digestible is generally just pop culture mental junk food or fear mongering &#8211; in other words, stuff that&#8217;s usually actively harmful.
