Melody Kramer is currently serving a two-year term appointment with [18F][1] and frequently works on side projects within the audio, public media, podcasting, and civic technology space. She is also a 2014-2015 [Visiting Nieman Fellow][2] at Harvard University and a weekly columnist for Poynter, where she covers people who live outside of SF/DC/NY who are doing amazing things in the news business.

She is a Peabody award-winning digital strategist and editor who spent the majority of her career at NPR, where she [launched and then managed projects][3] involving breaking news, analytics, archives, social media and long-term editorial strategies. She sat firmly at the intersection of NPR&#8217;s product and editorial teams, and [frequently][4] spoke at conferences and universities about building newsroom tools with, by and for the audience.

She previously launched and then led digital operations at [WHYY&#8217;s Fresh Air with Terry Gross][5], where she increased unique visitors to Fresh Air&#8217;s website by over 60 percent in two years, at a rate twice as fast as NPR&#8217;s flagship shows. Before that, she directed, edited, ran social media and wrote jokes for NPR&#8217;s humor show, [Wait Wait Don&#8217;t Tell Me][6] and wrote for National Geographic Magazine. Mel is a recipient of NPR&#8217;s [Kroc Fellowship][7], a full-year paid reporting fellowship given to three early-career journalists each year.

Mel is also a frequent guest lecturer and speaker on topics related to social and digital strategy. Her work has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, the Nieman Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards. She was recently the keynote speaker at the Social Learning Summit at American University and has lectured at the Columbia University School of Journalism, the University of Maryland, Drexel University, Northwestern University, Princeton University, Ohio State, the University of Florida, Georgetown University, and the University of Pennsylvania. She writes frequently about digital innovation for a variety of publications.

Outside of work, Mel volunteers as a teaching assistant at Python programming classes and frequently attends Code for DC, where she works on open-source web projects to benefit the District of Columbia. She also attends twice-weekly water aerobics classes at a public pool in DC, plays with her dog Sadie, reads quietly next to her partner A &#8212; who is not on any social media whatsoever &#8212; and tweets [@mkramer][8].
