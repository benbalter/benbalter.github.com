In their own words:\n\n> Emphasis provides dynamic paragraph-specific anchor links and the ability to highlight text in a document, all of which is made available in the URL hash so it can be emailed, bookmarked, or shared.\n\nI adapted the New York Time's implementation into a three-line WordPress plugin for my own site, and it is available in the [WordPress plugin repository][3] as a one-click install, if you would like to add it to your own.\n\nThe \"deep links\" plugin allows for permalinking and highlighting of text on a paragraph and sentance level. No need to set anything up. Just install, tap shift twice, and start highlighting.\n\n*See* [The New York Times post on the script][2] for syntax and more information on general usage or you can double tap the *shift* key right now to give it a try.\n\nNeat, huh?

The growing popularity of the cloud coupled with increasing power of smart phones has resulted in what not too long ago was tool for placing and receiving calls, today, in actuality, is a portal to one&#8217;s entire digital life. Imagine if a routine traffic stop, say, for failing to signal properly, would place in the state&#8217;s hands every e-mail you have ever sent, contact you have ever met, or financial transaction you have ever completed (not to mention your current <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds'>Angry Birds</a> score!). Regardless of how Orwellian it may sound, the California Supreme Court <a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/warrantless-cell-phone-search-gets-a-green-light-in-california.ars?comments=1#comments-bar'>ruled in favor of just such an outcome</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In <em><a href='http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S166600.PDF'>People v. Diaz</a></em>, the court ruled that a warrentless search of text messages on a cell phone confiscated subsequent to a lawful arrest did infact, constitute a valid search. While the dissent realized that mobile phones were increasingly becoming the hubs of our digital world, noting that the decision gave &#8221;<em>carte blanche, with no showing of exigency, to rummage at leisure through the wealth of personal and business information that can be carried on a mobile phone or handheld computer merely because the device was taken from an arrestee&#8217;s person,</em>&#8221; I do not believe they fully grasped the gravity of the ruling. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><img alt='' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/zoolander-300x188.jpg' /><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m_PncKuDao&amp;feature=related#t=1m16s'>Much like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson&#8217;s characters in the movie Zoolander</a>, the dissent&#8217;s analysis is based on the assumption that information &#8220;can be carried on&#8221; or &#8220;in&#8221; one&#8217;s mobile phone, a reality which simply is not the case in today&#8217;s increasingly cloud-centric world.</p>\n\n<p>Today, and even more so tomorrow, information will not be &#8220;carried on&#8221; a phone, but rather, that phone will merely be the vehicle used to access information stored elsewhere, information that would otherwise carry the highest expectation of privacy. Put another way, the device holds, both literally and metaphorically, the address, keys, and means to access one&#8217;s digital home, a breach of privacy that would not be tolerated if it occurred in a more tangible sense.</p>\n\n<p>In a world where in reality, nearly every e-mail I have ever sent or received can be accessed by opening a folder on my phone virtually indistinguishable <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> from any neighboring folder that contains locally stored information, the majority&#8217;s interpretation grants the state access to nearly everything one says or does on a daily basis.

Just scroll through your home screen. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The majority&#8217;s decision was well argued by legal minds much wiser than my own, but even reading through the verbiage of the opinion, discussing the nature of containers and cavities as they relate to what is &#8220;in&#8221; the phone, it leads one to believe that their analysis is handicapped by <a href='http://movieclips.com/sgNVB-zoolander-movie-computer-experts/'>outdated concepts of storage and space</a>. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>While it may not be practical to install <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage'>Faraday cages</a> in every police station to ferret out what information can be gleamed from a mobile device without it querying a remote server (if there is any information at all), the majority&#8217;s opinion fails to take into account the reality of how mobile phones are used today, let alone, how they will be most likely be used in the not-to-distant future.
