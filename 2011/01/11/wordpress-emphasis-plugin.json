Naturally, upon installing the app, the first thing to do is to try and ferret out the underlying XML API that powers it, a simple enough task given [the right tools][3].\r\n\r\nBelow you can find the details on GW's course schedule and campus map API endpoints, as well as an API wrapper to interact with it written in PHP. Feel free to grab the code below, or fork and contribute in the [GitHub repo][4]. Cool data that deserves to be shared with the world, no doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative ideas on how best to leverage the information welcome in the [comments below][5].\r\n\r\n*Please Note: I am not a GW employee, nor is use of the API explicitly authorized by the University.
