Over the past decade, federal IT spending has swelled nearly seventy percent, up from $45.6 billion in 2001, <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> for a total bill of more than $500 billion.<sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> This growth is partially a result of the unfortunate fact that as few as nine percent of projects are delivered on budget and on time.<sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that roughly forty-eight percent of all IT projects must be rebaselined, <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> and of those rebaselined projects, fifty-one percent must be rebaselined a second time.<sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Compounding the problem, end users fail entirely to use nearly forty-five percent of features procured and rarely use another nineteen percent of those features.<sup id='fnref:9'><a href='#fn:9' rel='footnote'>9</a></sup> Thus, purchasing agencies ultimately utilize only about one-third of all features paid for by American tax dollars.<sup id='fnref:10'><a href='#fn:10' rel='footnote'>10</a></sup> In the end, nearly forty-five percent of federally procured software features ultimately fail to meet the user&#8217;s needs.<sup id='fnref:11'><a href='#fn:11' rel='footnote'>11</a></sup> It is therefore no surprise that the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD) Robert Gates called federal IT procurement &#8220;baroque.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:12'><a href='#fn:12' rel='footnote'>12</a></sup> Too often IT procurement requirements are crafted with the input of neither end-users nor product developers.<sup id='fnref:13'><a href='#fn:13' rel='footnote'>13</a></sup> As Office of Management Budget (OMB) Director Peter R. Orszag noted, federal IT projects cost more than they should, take longer than they should, and often fail to meet agency needs.<sup id='fnref:14'><a href='#fn:14' rel='footnote'>14</a></sup> Today&#8217;s federal regulations shackle government agencies to outdated project management practices and prevent them from harnessing the true power of IT innovations, which have far outpaced the laws that govern them.<sup id='fnref:15'><a href='#fn:15' rel='footnote'>15</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>To better embrace innovation and respond to changing organizational needs, the Government must embrace a two-pronged approach involving both regulatory reform and top-down support for best-practices education to empower IT-procuring agencies to pursue more agile software development methods. By requiring that detailed specifications be outlined at the onset of the process, government procurement regulations encourage the less flexible, waterfall development techniques, rather than the more modern, agile development approaches used by the private sector today.<sup id='fnref:16'><a href='#fn:16' rel='footnote'>16</a></sup> While most prior attempts to reform federal IT procurement focused solely on statutory changes, <sup id='fnref:17'><a href='#fn:17' rel='footnote'>17</a></sup> this Note proposes more modern project management practices and argues for top-down reform on both a regulatory and a human level.</p>\n\n<h2 id='background-waterfall-v-agile'>I. Background — Waterfall v. Agile</h2>\n\n<p>Two primary schools of thought exist regarding software development practices: waterfall and agile software development. While today&#8217;s contracting regulations may propel agencies to use waterfall development, changes in industry practice with regard to large IT projects demands a government push toward more agile methodologies.</p>\n\n<h3 id='waterfall-software-development-sees-modern-software-development-as-an-extension-of-its-traditional-engineering-roots'>A. Waterfall Software Development Sees Modern Software Development as an Extension of its Traditional Engineering Roots</h3>\n\n<p>The traditional approach, &#8220;waterfall&#8221; software development, <sup id='fnref:18'><a href='#fn:18' rel='footnote'>18</a></sup> seeks all requirements and specifications up front, distinguishing design and analysis from construction and development.<sup id='fnref:19'><a href='#fn:19' rel='footnote'>19</a></sup> Waterfall development techniques trace their roots to long-standing engineering fields such as architecture and electrical engineering.<sup id='fnref:20'><a href='#fn:20' rel='footnote'>20</a></sup> In such fields, late changes are costly and rigid requirements are a practical necessity.<sup id='fnref:21'><a href='#fn:21' rel='footnote'>21</a></sup> With the rise of software development in the latter half of the twentieth century, engineers applied the same methodology to developing computer software.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their similar roots, traditional engineering is not a perfect metaphor for software development.<sup id='fnref:22'><a href='#fn:22' rel='footnote'>22</a></sup> First, unlike traditional engineering fields, software development benefits from nearly negligible switching costs.<sup id='fnref:23'><a href='#fn:23' rel='footnote'>23</a></sup> Second, the bulk of most software development projects is design and system architecture, a process requiring creative and analytical, rather than technical talent.<sup id='fnref:24'><a href='#fn:24' rel='footnote'>24</a></sup> In a world of widely adopted industry conventions, the creative necessities of a large-scale procurement project&#8217;s information architecture often overshadow technical necessities.<sup id='fnref:25'><a href='#fn:25' rel='footnote'>25</a></sup> Third, because software development regularly prioritizes designing ideal workflows and simplifying human interactions rather than embracing a formulaic science, such creative processes cannot easily be planned or predicted.<sup id='fnref:26'><a href='#fn:26' rel='footnote'>26</a></sup> In light of these industry trends, modern software development has recently embraced a more integrated practice known as agile software development.<sup id='fnref:27'><a href='#fn:27' rel='footnote'>27</a></sup></p>\n\n<h3 id='agile-software-development-mitigates-the-risk-inherent-in-uncertainty-by-approaching-a-project-as-multiple-independent-tasks'>B. Agile Software Development Mitigates the Risk Inherent in Uncertainty by Approaching a Project as Multiple Independent Tasks</h3>\n\n<p>Agile development adopts an incremental approach to software development, but it does not seek to build software systems in a sequential, step-wise manner. Instead it recognizes the reality that a future system owner may be unable to gather all requirements up front.<sup id='fnref:28'><a href='#fn:28' rel='footnote'>28</a></sup> Even if this were possible, those requirements likely would change over time to reflect shifting technological and organizational priorities.<sup id='fnref:29'><a href='#fn:29' rel='footnote'>29</a></sup> Thus the project is broken down into several smaller components.<sup id='fnref:30'><a href='#fn:30' rel='footnote'>30</a></sup> Plans are continuously inspected and adapted to the empirical reality of the project through rapid prototyping.<sup id='fnref:31'><a href='#fn:31' rel='footnote'>31</a></sup> As a practice widely used in the private sector, empirically agile development delivers better performing projects on time and under budget.<sup id='fnref:32'><a href='#fn:32' rel='footnote'>32</a></sup></p>\n\n<h3 id='modern-trends-in-both-governance-and-technology-push-federal-procurement-towards-agility'>C.

Despite its Advantages and Long-Standing History, the Rigidity of Traditional Software Development Bears Risks Disproportionate to its Returns</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional software development methodologies, commonly known as waterfall software development, are defined primarily by a sequential process <sup id='fnref:39'><a href='#fn:39' rel='footnote'>39</a></sup> consisting primarily of two distinct stages: analysis and coding.<sup id='fnref:40'><a href='#fn:40' rel='footnote'>40</a></sup> The analysis stage, which in some situations can span months or even years, <sup id='fnref:41'><a href='#fn:41' rel='footnote'>41</a></sup> asks prospective system owners to outline all conceivable requirements in a rigidly structured process before formally giving the requirements documentation to a software development team.<sup id='fnref:42'><a href='#fn:42' rel='footnote'>42</a></sup> The development team then completes a prolonged development cycle, fulfilling the specifications the customer described in the requirements documentation.<sup id='fnref:43'><a href='#fn:43' rel='footnote'>43</a></sup> Following this cycle, stakeholders and developers come together (for the first time) to verify that the software meets all initial specifications.<sup id='fnref:44'><a href='#fn:44' rel='footnote'>44</a></sup> These five steps are traditionally understood as the typical waterfall framework completed over the course of the procurement system.<sup id='fnref:45'><a href='#fn:45' rel='footnote'>45</a></sup> While waterfall development provides many advantages in the federal contracting environment, it also introduces many shortcomings both conceptually and practically.</p>\n\n<h3 id='the-rigidity-of-the-waterfall-process-brings-several-advantages-to-federal-it-procurement'>A. The Rigidity of the Waterfall Process Brings Several Advantages to Federal IT Procurement</h3>\n\n<p>In both form and function, waterfall development mirrors current procurement models. The first step requires that future system owners document their needs extensively, and such requirements are easily incorporated into a solicitation. This up-front documentation allows agencies to safely budget funds and allows contracting officers (COs) to marry funds to specific, pre-defined contractual events. &#8220;Phase gates&#8221; within the contract provide agencies objective standards to evaluate a project&#8217;s propensity for success and allow agencies to abandon projects in some instances when the prospect of successful delivery appears grim. Within an agency, waterfall development requires COs to justify projects to stakeholders early in the development cycle, and this overall process has gained agencies&#8217; tacit endorsement over the years.<sup id='fnref:46'><a href='#fn:46' rel='footnote'>46</a></sup> By nature of its formal requirements, waterfall software development leaves behind it a wake of documentation, the lifeblood of bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<h3 id='waterfall-software-development-fails-to-adequately-respond-to-the-ever-changing-conditions-that-make-up-a-project%e2%80%99s-problem-space'>B. Waterfall Software Development Fails to Adequately Respond to the Ever-Changing Conditions that Make Up a Project&#8217;s Problem Space</h3>\n\n<p>Despite its long-standing history, waterfall software development comes with shortcomings. The outdated methodology assumes requirements can be predicted upfront. As a result it fails to adequately respond to changing conditions and forces agencies to incur costs disproportionate to project returns.</p>\n\n<h4 id='both-conceptually-and-practically-waterfall-assumes-that-contracting-agencies-can-accurately-forecast-a-project%e2%80%99s-requirements-in-advance'>i. Both conceptually and practically, waterfall assumes that contracting agencies can accurately forecast a project&#8217;s requirements in advance</h4>\n\n<p>Waterfall relies on two key assumptions: (A) That requirements are fully understood by both contractor and contracting agency, and (B) That requirements are unlikely to change.<sup id='fnref:47'><a href='#fn:47' rel='footnote'>47</a></sup> Yet due to the often-unique nature of government systems, software contractors typically face challenges to which they have never been exposed, rendering predicting of future needs an inherently futile task.<sup id='fnref:48'><a href='#fn:48' rel='footnote'>48</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The traditional procurement model, which leans heavily on waterfall&#8217;s central tenants, demands specificity in planning, funding, and acquisition, and requires the contractors and COs to attain a certain level of &#8220;predictive precision&#8221; simply not found in the ever-changing world of technology.<sup id='fnref:49'><a href='#fn:49' rel='footnote'>49</a></sup> As such, by requiring that all specifications be outlined upfront, the current procurement model encourages agencies to attempt an inevitably unsuccessful endeavor and thereby increases project risk.<sup id='fnref:50'><a href='#fn:50' rel='footnote'>50</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The unrealistic premises of waterfall procurement create a snowball effect. Because it is impossible for COs to resolve all unknowns at the onset of a procurement, they often err on the side of caution and compound errors by over-documenting requirements and making erroneous assumptions.<sup id='fnref:51'><a href='#fn:51' rel='footnote'>51</a></sup> This risk is further exacerbated as a result of waterfall&#8217;s insistence on delaying testing until late in the development cycle, <sup id='fnref:52'><a href='#fn:52' rel='footnote'>52</a></sup> meaning mistakes often do not become apparent until corrections are cost-prohibitive.<sup id='fnref:53'><a href='#fn:53' rel='footnote'>53</a></sup> Especially given the size of typical government procurements, &#8220;[t]rying to implement everything at once increases the risk of failure on a grand scale if the technology fails to work as expected or if the original idea was misconceived.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:54'><a href='#fn:54' rel='footnote'>54</a></sup> To function optimally, waterfall methodologies require both contracting parties to possess perfect information. This a practical impossibility when federal agencies acquire major IT systems.</p>\n\n<h4 id='waterfall-development-fails-to-adequately-respond-to-change'>ii. Waterfall development fails to adequately respond to change</h4>\n\n<p>A single-pass approach assumes that all variables remain constant throughout the contracting process.<sup id='fnref:55'><a href='#fn:55' rel='footnote'>55</a></sup> Yet experts and lay consumers alike know that technology slowly nudges even the most recent purchases toward obsolescence.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should oversee the joint efforts of the General Services Administration (GSA), the White House OMB, <sup id='fnref:150'><a href='#fn:150' rel='footnote'>150</a></sup> and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to educate COs as to agile contracting best practices.<sup id='fnref:151'><a href='#fn:151' rel='footnote'>151</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Solicitations should outline functional rather than technical requirements <sup id='fnref:152'><a href='#fn:152' rel='footnote'>152</a></sup> and should be crafted without the significant lead time often characteristic of government procurement. The statement of work should specify high-level goals or systems, rather than specific features, and these goals should eventually become the framework that defines each subsequent sprint. The contract should also include specific, functional milestones and accompanying deadlines, which may also be married to an award schedule.</p>\n\n<h4 id='agency-technical-contacts-cotrs-must-learn-best-practices-in-agile-project-management'>ii. Agency technical contacts (COTRs) must learn best practices in agile project management</h4>\n\n<p>Alongside existing professional development efforts, contracting organization technical representatives must be trained in best practices for executing and managing development projects through an agile framework. This may include formal workshops for employees; the recruitment of experienced, private sector project managers; or simply a push to increase awareness of agile methodology and educational resources already at agencies&#8217; disposal.</p>\n\n<h3 id='existing-procurement-requirements-demand-extensive-documentation-up-front-forcing-agencies-into-agile-frameworks'>B. Existing Procurement Requirements Demand Extensive Documentation Up Front, Forcing Agencies into Agile Frameworks</h3>\n\n<p>Even if an agile-friendly contracts are prepared, executed, and overseen successfully, two statutory stumbling blocks may hinder agile&#8217;s adoption: (i) the solicitation and subsequent award of the contract; and (ii) the governance of the contract while it is in progress.<sup id='fnref:153'><a href='#fn:153' rel='footnote'>153</a></sup></p>\n\n<h4 id='engineering-services-far-part-36'>i. Engineering services, FAR Part 36</h4>\n\n<p>The single largest statutory roadblock to agile-friendly contracts is the requirement for technical specifications prior to solicitation. This requirement locks contracting agencies into a waterfall method post-award and is antithetical to agile methodologies. To pursue an agile framework, agencies should establish functional rather than technical benchmarks, developing a framework that can be used to define the focus of each subsequent sprint.</p>\n\n<p>Part 36 of the FAR provides a modified procedure for procuring architectural and engineering services.<sup id='fnref:154'><a href='#fn:154' rel='footnote'>154</a></sup> Such a procurement would follow a two-phase procedure. In phase one competing firms would submit proposals including their technical approaches and technical qualifications, but these would not include detailed design information or cost or price information. Agencies would then rank the top firms, which would be asked to submit detailed proposals before the winning firm was selected for a contract to be executed through the design-build framework.<sup id='fnref:155'><a href='#fn:155' rel='footnote'>155</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Under FAR 36.601(4)(a)(3), to be eligible for the architecture-engineering route, the acquisition must &#8220;logically or justifiably require performance by registered architects or engineers or their employees.&#8221; <sup id='fnref:156'><a href='#fn:156' rel='footnote'>156</a></sup> Congress should expand the definition of this section to include computer and software engineers to allow IT procurement to follow this route.</p>\n\n<h4 id='modular-contracting-far-part-39'>ii. Modular contracting, FAR Part 39</h4>\n\n<p>FAR 39.103 allows agencies to break large acquisitions into several smaller acquisition increments.<sup id='fnref:157'><a href='#fn:157' rel='footnote'>157</a></sup> To aid in accounting, budgeting, and documentation, an agile procurement can be contracted as one overarching contract defining the scope of the work and outlining a schedule by which each sprint&#8217;s focus will be defined. This large contract may incorporate smaller contracts for each subsequent sprint, if necessary, as part of a process wholly in line with the Government&#8217;s push toward system-oriented architectures.</p>\n\n<h3 id='cos-lack-top-down-support-for-it-procurement-reform'>C. COs Lack Top-Down Support for IT Procurement Reform</h3>\n\n<p>The above goals cannot be realized without significant top-down support from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, OMB, and Chief Technology Officers at each agency. COs must be empowered to take risks with such an unconventional approach. While top administration officials have made statements supporting an agile approach to IT procurement reform, such rhetoric remains noncommittal. Tangible, specific guidance from senior administration officials to agency CIOs and CFOs must occur in order for innovation to succeed.</p>\n\n<h2 id='conclusion'>VI. Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The federal IT procurement system is outdated. Projects are consistently delivered late, over-budget, and obsolete. Much of this trend can be traced back to flawed legal frameworks that lock agencies and contractors into an outdated development model. Through education, reform, and organization-wide support, federal agility can become a reality. Any computer user knows that as systems age they begin to slow. Today, the federal IT procurement system is running slowly, to the detriment of both agencies and the public, and it is long overdue for a system-wide upgrade.</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/'><img alt='Creative Commons License' class='aligncenter' src='http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png' /></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Originally published in The Public Contract Law Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1.

In 1983 the PTO initiated a billion-dollar automation effort using waterfall. At the time the PTO&#8217;s patent files contained some thirty-three million documents, supporting patents issued since 1790, and grew at the rate of approximately one million documents per year. The goal was to have a fully deployed system by 1990, however by 1987, the PTO began to realize that the program was fatally behind schedule and switched to an agile approach. Course Manual , <em>supra</em> note 28, at 66-67<strong>.</strong>The PTO was able to successfully deploy its patent search system (CSIR) later that year, and by 1992 had a significant portion of its automation system integrated into its workflow.

Similarly, after spending nearly two years and 0 million dollars developing handheld computers for use in conjunction with the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau was forced to drop its plans and revert to paper-based collection when it realized the waterfall approach it had adopted would not deliver a working system in time for the census data collection.
