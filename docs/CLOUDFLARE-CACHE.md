# Cloudflare Workers Deployment

This document explains how the site is deployed to Cloudflare Workers using Workers Static Assets.

## Overview

The site is deployed directly to Cloudflare Workers via the [`cf` CLI](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-cf-cli-launch/). Cloudflare Workers Static Assets automatically handles serving static files, so no manual cache purging is needed.

## How It Works

1. **Build**: GitHub Actions builds the Astro site, outputting static files to `dist-astro/`
2. **Bundle**: `npx cf-wrangler build` bundles the Worker and copies `dist-astro/` into `.cloudflare/output/`
3. **Deploy**: `npx cf deploy --prebuilt` uploads that output to Cloudflare Workers. `--prebuilt` matters: cf detects Astro and would otherwise run bare `astro build`, skipping pagefind and the inject scripts
4. **Cache**: Cloudflare Workers automatically invalidates its cache on each new deployment. Astro also generates content-hashed filenames for JS/CSS assets (e.g., `global.E-nqILv5.css`), providing additional cache busting.

## Configuration

### Required Secrets

The deployment workflow requires two GitHub repository secrets:

1. **`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`**: Your Cloudflare account ID
   - Find this in Cloudflare Dashboard → any domain → Overview (right sidebar)

2. **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`**: An API token with Cloudflare Workers permissions
   - Create at: Cloudflare Dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token
   - Use the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template, or create a custom token with:
     - **Account → Cloudflare Workers Scripts → Edit**
   - Recommended: Scope to your account

### Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add both secrets:
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, Value: `your-account-id`
   - Name: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, Value: `your-api-token`

### Project Configuration

The Cloudflare Workers project is configured in two files:

- `cloudflare.config.ts`: the Worker itself (name, entrypoint, bindings, `runWorkerFirst` routing, observability)
- `wrangler.config.ts`: build-tool settings for Wrangler, which `cf` delegates to (the `dist-astro/` assets directory)

To deploy locally: `npm run build && npx cf-wrangler build && npx cf deploy --prebuilt`.

### Custom Domain

Configure your custom domain in Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → your worker → Settings → Domains & Routes. The `CNAME` file in the repository root is no longer used for deployment.

## Headers and Redirects

Cloudflare Workers Static Assets uses files in the `public/` directory:

- **`public/_headers`**: Security headers, caching rules, and CSP
- **`public/_redirects`**: URL redirects (301s for old slugs, feed URLs, etc.)

These are automatically picked up by Cloudflare Workers Static Assets during deployment.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Minimal Permissions**: API token should only have Cloudflare Workers edit permission
2. **Account Scoping**: Restrict token to your specific account
3. **Secret Rotation**: Rotate API tokens periodically
4. **Don't Commit**: Never commit secrets to the repository
