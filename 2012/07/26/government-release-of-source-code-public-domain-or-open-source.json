My response? <em>I wouldn&#8217;t.</em></p>\n\n<p>A dashboard in a car or airplane makes sense. It&#8217;s not as if I could click &#8220;speedometer&#8221; while driving or press the &#8220;altimeter&#8221; button while flying. I simply need everything at all times. But virtual interfaces don&#8217;t have that same limitation. In fact they don&#8217;t have any limitations. A dashboard can have as much information as the most ambitious engineer can dream — and that&#8217;s exactly the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Put it in context: Google <a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html'>recently announced the retirement of iGoogle</a>, it&#8217;s own personalized dashboard, and I second their nomination to induct dashboards into the #doingitwrong hall of fame, joining the likes of internet portals, splash pages, and well, basically anything involving ActiveX or Flash.</p>\n\n<p>Dashboard were a fun user interface experiment. They really were, especially compared to the static pages they evolved from. That was the whole point of Web 2.0, wasn&#8217;t it? Personalization? I mean, it was really cool to drag and drop widgets, and build a virtual command center to monitor my little corner of the internet, and that was fine when there wasn&#8217;t much internet out there to monitor. But the web collectively hit a tipping point a few years back. From push notifications to always-on e-mail, in more ways than we imagine, we now bombard ourselves with more information that we can physically process at any given moment. <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html'>Quite literally</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it this way: when customers come to a website, they&#8217;re not looking to solve 10 problems. They&#8217;re looking to solve one. They don&#8217;t want all the potentially relevant information thrown at them all at once; they just want what they need. And they want computers to make that determination for them. But hey, this isn&#8217;t the first time those who predict our user experience needs have erred on the side of <a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/images/dynamic/NEWS-32125-b3a8b509bc5e3a074f7f240f57d71aa9.jpg'>moar is better</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it? That&#8217;s the end of simultaneous streams? <a href='http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/productivity_apps/240003296'>Far from it</a>. This once-disruptive technology now has a long journey down the Technology S Curve as it becomes the go-to solution for all the business intelligence and project analyst types that stumble across it, in other words, the late adopters.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m sure guilty of building <a href='http://my.fcc.gov/'>a dashboard</a> or <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen'>two</a> in my day. I&#8217;m not saying that they&#8217;ve never had a place. What I&#8217;m saying is that today, not even the most complex dashboard could give you an accurate snapshot of its genus&#8217;s future. If not dashes, then what? Beyond turning everything into a ubiquitous search box (<em>a la</em> <a href='http://gov.uk'>gov.uk</a>), I&#8217;m far from for a UI/UX expert, but I tend to think that startups generally have a pretty good sense of what&#8217;s next. They have to. If they don&#8217;t get it right the first time around, they tend not to have a second try. So what do we see?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Activity -</strong> Social apps like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, even GitHub are all built around the concept of activity. Whether its a news feed, recent checkins, or even commit activity, the question I come with is &#8220;what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and it gets answered as in depth as I care to scroll through, not as in depth as an engineer arbitrarily decided I needed a few years back. It&#8217;s linear. It&#8217;s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid'>inverted pyramid</a>. It&#8217;s customized by whom or what I follow, not by what I add or (re)arrange.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimal</strong> – Productivity apps like Gmail, Google Reader, even dropbox don&#8217;t summarize for me how many e-mails, unread posts, or free MB I have as soon as I log in, and with the exception of a few labs features here or there, don&#8217;t even give me the option to have anything more than a bare-bones inbox, unread feed, or directory listing. In fact, GMail and Google Reader were recently criticized for <a href='http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/gmail-designer-arrogance-and-the-cult-of-minimalism/'>going a bit too far</a> in this direction. But the lesson is the same: just give me my stuff and get out of the way.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p><strong>Immediate</strong> - Transactional apps, like Uber or Square focus on action, not the past (or even the present). When I open the Uber or square apps, I&#8217;m immediately presented with the ability to request a vehicle or swipe a card, not my top tasks, not an arbitrary array of options or metrics, not with recent news about the product or popular add-ons. The app simply stands at attention, awaiting orders. I actually had to dig a bit to find my transaction history and related business analytics, and I&#8217;d argue that&#8217;s a really good thing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Think about the last time you&#8217;ve used a drag-and-drop dashboard: If you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s going to be either Google Analytics or WordPress, and if that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s simply known as <em>the screen you see after you log in, but before you can do what you need to do</em>. It&#8217;s wasted pixels. It&#8217;s cruft from a bygone era when clicks were expensive and developers were left wondering &#8220;how can we fit more on a page&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Options are a crutch. It&#8217;s the natural tendency of any engineer to over engineer a system, and that tendency is even stronger in a risk-averse, top-down culture <a href='http://www.google.com/?q=dashboard+site:.gov'>like government</a>. But your job — as an engineer, as a product manager, as user — is to push back, to fight that urge, to make <a href='http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/'>decisions, not options</a>. Not convinced? That feature you can&#8217;t <a href='https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning'>bring yourself to cut</a>? Expose it through your API and see how many users complain.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no longer a question of &#8220;is this possible technologically?&#8221;. It&#8217;s no longer a matter of &#8220;can you expose me to that information 24/7?&#8221;. Ever since the advent of <a href='http://html5zombo.com/'>Zombo com</a>, the only limit is our imagination. We&#8217;ve figured out the hard stuff. It&#8217;s not centralization and personalization. It&#8217;s decentralization and interoperability. Simplicity is the new black.</p>","content":"<p>A petition was recently posted on <a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/'>We The People</a> demanding <a href='https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/maximize-public-benefit-federal-technology-sharing-government-developed-software-under-open-source/6n5ZBBwf?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl'>that federally funded software be released under an open source license</a>. Makes sense. The public should have access to what is technically their property.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120723/12181319800/should-software-created-federal-govt-be-open-source-licensed-public-domain.shtml'>TechDirt posed the question</a> of whether it should be released under an open-source license or public domain, and I&#8217;m afraid they really missed the point.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that the creator of the petition was simply asking the question &#8220;I can haz source code?&#8221; Plain and simple. Put it in context: 99% of the time when an organization (or an individual) releases software to the public, they do so under the terms of an open source license. It tells users what they can and can&#8217;t do, and tells contributors under what terms they can contribute. It&#8217;s set&#8217;s the ground rules. It&#8217;s a contract with the public. It&#8217;s a prenup for code.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the issue? Although I generally dread the phrase, in this case, government is objectively different. Under 17 U.S.C § 105 US Government Works are not subject to domestic copyright protection. It&#8217;s not technically public domain, but it&#8217;s close enough. <sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Any US citizen can use the code any way they wish. There&#8217;s simply no copyright, thus no need to license. <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> And this entire debate is a moot point if the software is a derivative work of a viral license like the GPL, the most common open source license. <sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>That of course, only applies to code created by a US government employee, an increasingly rare occurrence. <sup id='fnref:4'><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup> Absent permission from the contracting officer, the US government retains unlimited rights for all work created under contract (including the right to redistribute). <sup id='fnref:5'><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup> And again a moot point if GPL derivative (and thus must be given to the Government under the GPL.)</p>\n\n<p>Yet all this is very academic (not to mention dry). Waldo Jaquith and Anil Dash <a href='https://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/227476701599391744'>made a great suggestion</a>: let&#8217;s be pragmatic here. Government doesn&#8217;t hold on to software because they are concerned about licensing. They hold on to software because they have better things to do, because it&#8217;s not within the culture, and because there&#8217;s no angry mob slamming a battering ram against the metaphorical front gates when they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the nuances of federal procurement law is even close to the first thing we should care about here. <sup id='fnref:6'><a href='#fn:6' rel='footnote'>6</a></sup> The concern is about whether feds should do the leg work to open source it or not. The question for us as developers, for the thought leaders in the space, isn&#8217;t how should the US government best license / not license software, but <em>how can the open source community help it to do so.</em> How can we get more software out the door? In a world of finite time, <em>how can we make open sourcing</em> <sup id='fnref:7'><a href='#fn:7' rel='footnote'>7</a></sup> <em>a bonafide priority</em>?</p>\n\n<p>How? For one, involvement in existing open source projects <sup id='fnref:8'><a href='#fn:8' rel='footnote'>8</a></sup> would surely send a strong message that there&#8217;s latent demand here, and would give the foot soldiers political air cover to forge onward with their efforts. For another, taking ownership of the code itself, and realizing it is <em>our</em> code, not the government&#8217;s would surely change the tone of the debate by encouraging agencies to ship code sooner, rather than delaying release out of fear of criticism.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, it&#8217;s about what role we are going to play, not what rights we are going to receive. Let&#8217;s at least get the source code, then we can go back to our regularly scheduled holy wars over licensing.</p>\n\n<p><em>As always, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/fine-print/'>views are my own</a>.</em></p>\n<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>\n<p>I&#8217;d argue that all software, even government funded software should still be licensed under a traditional open source license, to resolve any legal ambiguity when used abroad under the terms of various international copyright treaties and agreements</p>\n<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>\n<p>Although citizen-contributions to that project would theoretically not be public domain, thus necessitating a license, which should be clarified in the project&#8217;s documentation at the time of release to avoid potential issues with 21 U.S.C. § 1342.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:3'>\n<p>Although again, technically speaking the project as a whole would be licensed under GPL, individual code not dependent on the parent project could be used as a US Government Work.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:4'>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re looking at the <a href='https://github.com/languages/ColdFusion'>vibrant open source cold fusion community</a>.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:4' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:5'>\n<p>FAR 52.227-14(c)(1)(i).
