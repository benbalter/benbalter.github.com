I'm always intreagued by developers who use the term "open source" as a verb. As if a switch could be magically switched, and via a quick mouse click in the [Danger Zone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8rZWw9HE7o), a proprietary or purpose-built project quickly becomes "open source".

Open source is not simply about publishing code. That'd be like saying democracy's simply about the ability to vote. Sure, you can vote, but if your vote doesn't matter because it's symbolic, it's not really democracy. Like publishing code, voting is necessary but not sufficient.

Open source, at its core, is not about code, but about connecting people around a shared vision. It's about community buidling. It's about getting a bunch of ethusiastic, like-minded folks in a room together, and giving them the resources to solve a problem and create something of mutual benefit, something that none of them would have been able to do alone. It's about creating and sharing, not publishing. It's an idea.

Similarly, open source is not an alternative workflow or development method. It's not as if you can choose between waterfall, agile, and open souce means of producing software. Instead, it's a philosophy to guide a project. Like forward thinking, interoperable, system oriented, or open standards. It's how you approach a problem, not what you do after you've solved it.

To say "hey, let's take this closed-sourced project and just hit publish" misses the mark. It's not about seeking free labor, as in "hey, if developers want to give us their time, great", or about sparatically seeking to garner good will from a niche community. An open source developer can smell astroturf a mile a way. 

So what makes an open source project truly open source and not simply "published"?

1. **Shared Vision** - Open source developers want to get behind a cause. Think of it as analogous to volunteering for a political campaign. They want to know what the project stands for, and where it is going. If they contribute, what will their code be used for in a six months or a year?
2. **Clear Goals** - What's the goal of the project? What's the roadmap look like? Do you trust the community enough to share it? Can they shape that roadmap or is it set in stone?
3. **Active Development** - When's the last public commit? Are you commiting privately, bundling together a release and then blessing the community with your efforts or is development occuring in the open?
4. **Us/Them Mentality** - Is there a class system between paid/unpaid contributors? Are outside contributions handled with equal footing? Are any outside developers delegate authority or given commit access?
5. **Mechanics** - Is it in version control or just a static download? Is the bug tracker public? Can I comment and submit? What about documentation? Is it maintained in a wiki?
6. **Communication** - Can developers communicate directly or must they go through the parent organization? (e.g., annoucment verses conversation models)
