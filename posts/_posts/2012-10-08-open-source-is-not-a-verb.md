I'm always intreagued by developers who use the term "open source" as a verb. As if a switch could be magically switched, and via a quick mouse click in the [Danger Zone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8rZWw9HE7o), a proprietary or purpose-built project quickly becomes "open source".

Open source is not simply about publishing code. That'd be like saying democracy's simply about the ability to vote. Sure, you can vote, but if your vote doesn't matter because it's symbolic, it's not really democracy. Like publishing code, voting is necessary but not sufficient.

Open source, at its core, is not about code, but about connecting people around a shared vision. It's about getting a bunch of ethusiastic, like-minded folks in a room together, and giving them the resources to create something of mutual benefit, something that none of them would have been able to do alone. It's about creating and sharing, not about publishing. It's an idea.

Similarly, open source is not and alternative workflow or development method. It's not as if you can choose between waterfall, agile, and open souce. It's a philosophy to guide a project. Like forward thinking, interoperable, system oriented, or open standards. It's how you approach a problem, not what you do after you've solved it.
