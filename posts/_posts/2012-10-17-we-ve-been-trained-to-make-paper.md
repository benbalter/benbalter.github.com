We've been trained wrong. We've been trained that content creation starts by firing up a desktop word processor — a piece of software, mind you, that still generates a digital representation of a physical piece of paper — margins, page breaks, and all. Yet this quitesential bussiness-place training simply fails to remain relevant in a world where we cary a computer in our pockets at all times. The result is that our training now tells us to create content for the least-likely way it's consumed. We're stuck in yesterday's workflows. 

The typical collaborative publishing workflow usually goes something like this:

1. Draft content in Microsoft Word
2. Save to shared folder or e-mail around for comments and changes
3. Manually (and opaquely) reconsile changes one-by-one
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until satisfied with the document
5. **Convert to web-friendly format**
6. Publish

See what we did there? We're still writing content for print, and then once we're completely done, preparing it for web. That's broken. That's like building an entire car, and then at the last minute, deciding it should actually, in fact, be a plane. If the internet is the primary medium by which content is consumed, shouldn't that be the primary medium for which content is written?

Microsoft Word was designed with one purpose in mind: to make paper. Think about it. It's essential design elements arose in the early 80's. There's print-centric buttons like left and right align front and center, but new-fangled internety things like hyperlinks or rich media are buried deep inside these labyrinthian sub-menus. It's a workflow that arose before the age of the web (and hasn't really changed since).

Yet the majority of the documents we create today rarely ever embody physical space.  They don't care about margin width, page breaks, or other properties that assume four sharp corners, and more importantly, they also don't handle responsiveness, machine-readability, or other web-specific features.

And then there's the problem of version control. I can't count the number of times I've been e-mailed a document entitled `foo-document_2012_10_15_clean_fixed_revised_final2` and told that it's "on the share drive" or asked "are you out yet?". *What updates does this version have that weren't in the last? Wait is this even the most recent version? Who made the last three revisions? What happend with that change I submitted - did you accept it? Why not? Can we discuss? Can two people edit it at the same time? Not to mention — I have a crazy idea — can I go off and experiment in a parallel version?*

Geeks solved this problem a long time ago. It's called version control. We built it in the 70's. We start with content, you edit it, I edit it, and we get better content. It's really that simple, and better yet, it's free. It handles curating the master copy, keeps track of each and every change (down to the character mind you), and even provides a transparent forum to discuss those changes in the context in which they occur. [Take a look](https://github.com/benbalter/benbalter.github.com/commits/master/posts/_posts/2012-10-17-we-ve-been-trained-to-make-paper.md).

Why doesn't everyone use this "version control"? Because we've got to break free of these proprietary, print-only formats. We've got to unprogram how we've been trained to create. Proprietary document formats tend to interweave the content we create with the commands the software needs to format it, and it stores all this in a complicated and inaccessable binary format. We put text in, we get this big mess back that can only be opened by that software. *.doc files are like tiny micro-jails for content and it's time for a jail break.* 

We've got to start concentrating on what matters: the content. Text. Markdown. YAML.


When you separate design from content, things get a lot easier. Make a change? I can see that down to the letter.
