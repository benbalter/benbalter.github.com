Over the years I've written a number of posts about GitHub's culture and communication patterns. If you're joining (or preparing for an interview at) GitHub, here are some of my favorite posts that might help you understand how GitHub works and what it's like to be a GitHubber:

<ul>

  <PostLink url="/2016/10/31/eight-things-i-wish-i-knew-my-first-week-at-github/" />

  <PostLink url="/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/" />

  <PostLink url="/2023/01/10/manage-like-an-engineer/" />
</ul>

If you're looking to learn even more about how GitHub works, it's culture, and what it's like to be a GitHubber, you can also check out some of [the books that have significantly influenced my time at GitHub](/other-recommended-reading/) that I often recommend to others.

Of course, these opinions are [my own](/fine-print/), and please take the publication date in mind when reading. GitHub (and I) have changed a lot since 2013, and as organizations grow and mature, cultures and communication patterns naturally evolve. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out](/contact/).
