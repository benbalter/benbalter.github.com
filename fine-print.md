This is my personal Web site. The opinions expressed herein represent my own, and not those of any employer, group, or organization.

You should know that I am not an expert. My views do not constitute legal advice, nor is their validity, accuracy, currentness, or completeness guaranteed. If you need a lawyer, please find a licensed attorney in your state, or wait a few years until I sit for the bar.

Finally, be aware that I often use the [old AP style for “Web site”][1] out of habit and am a strong proponent of the [serial comma][2].
